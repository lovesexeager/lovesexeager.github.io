First is confidence , then joy . Confidence is not enough, and joy is the hard part. Definitions # Confidence : Knowing what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. Knowing that your genitals are made of the same parts as everyone else\u2019s, organized in a unique way. Knowing about the brakes and accelerator. Knowing about context and about the difference between liking, wanting, and learning. Knowing about arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Knowing what\u2019s really true, even when it\u2019s not what you were taught \u201cshould\u201d be true. Knowing what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you wish were true. Joy : Loving what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. Loving your genitals, your brakes and accelerator, and the way your brain responds to context. Loving the context itself. Loving arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Loving what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you were taught \u201cshould\u201d be true. Loving what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you wish were true. Negative feelings : Feelings like hate, angry, frustration, despair, disappoinment and shame. Broken : Not normal , the cultural meaning. Ussually implies damaged, inadequate, or diseased. It\u2019s something wrong with you. Script : Something that shoud be that way. Map (Model) : An abstract representation of something that exists in reality. Our sexual scripts are maps . Normal # Cultural meaning : You are like cultural messages says you should be. Which is totally imposible because many cultural messages are opposites. True meaning : Totally healthy, just same parts as everyone else, organized in a unique way. Everyone who is healthy (physical and mentally) is normal. Cultural messages # Includes moral, media and medical messages. Moral messages : You are evil. If you want or like sex, you\u2019re a slut. Your virginity is your most valuable asset. If you\u2019ve had too many partners (\u201ctoo many\u201d = more than your male partner has had), you should be ashamed. There is only one right way to behave and one right way to feel about sex\u2014not to feel anything about it at all but to accommodate the man to whom your body belongs. [\u2026] If you are sexually desirable, you are, by definition, unlovable, and a slut. Media messages : You are inadequate. Spanking, food play, m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois\u2026 you\u2019ve done all these things, right? Well, you\u2019ve at least had clitoral orgasms, vaginal orgasms, uterine orgasms, energy orgasms, extended orgasms, and multiple orgasms? And you\u2019ve mastered at least thirty-five different positions for intercourse? If you don\u2019t try all these things, you\u2019re frigid. If you\u2019ve had too few partners, don\u2019t watch porn, and don\u2019t have a collection of vibrators in your bedside table, you\u2019re a prude. Also: You\u2019re too fat and too thin; your breasts are too big and too small. Your body is wrong. If you\u2019re not trying to change it, you\u2019re lazy. If you\u2019re satisfied with yourself as you are, you\u2019re settling. And if you dare to actively like yourself, you\u2019re a conceited bitch. In short, you are doing it wrong. Do it differently. No, that\u2019s wrong, too, try something else. Forever. Medical messages : You are deseased. Sex causes disease and pregnancy, which makes it dangerous. But if you\u2019re ready to take that risk, sexual functioning should happen in a particular way \u2014 desire, then arousal, then orgasm, preferably during intercourse, simultaneously with your partner \u2014 and when it doesn\u2019t, there is a medical issue that you must address. Medically. With medication. Or possibly surgery. To the extent that a woman\u2019s sexual response differs from a man\u2019s, she is diseased \u2014 except for pregnancy, which is what sex is for. Why confidence is not enough? # Because maybe you know what is true about yourself but you don\u2019t accept it. So you hit your Brakes. There are three ways that may make you struggle reaching joy : To think of yourself as lesser. A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that \u2018responsive desire\u2019 is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire. Most women have \u201ca lesser desire?\u201d Yeowch. The construction of responsive desire as \u201clesser\u201d is not a \u201cfact,\u201d of course; it\u2019s a value judgment, an opinion. Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are broken . The worst case is when these people are people you love. To have negative feelings about what is true of yourself, for being as you are. The map and the terrain # How to bridge from confidence to joy ? # Step 1: Your feelings are always true # Your feelings are always true, so notice them. If you have negative feelings experiencing your sexuality probably it\u2019s your little monitor fault, noticing that the expectations you have for your goals are not being met. So close the gap by reality-check . Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual scripts . These scripts provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these scripts act as barriers between us and joy. The map and terrain # What would you say if a map doesn\u2019t match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes? Which is wrong, the map or the terrain? Everyone would probably say that it is the terrain that is wrong. But what if everyone says the map is right and it\u2019s the terrain you\u2019re looking at which\u2019s wrong? Our sexual scripts are our the map , and our experiences are our terrain.","title":"Chapter 9: Love what is true"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True/#chapter-9-love-what-is-true","text":"This chapter is about how to reach the ecstasy through confidence and joy in whole you.
