First is confidence , then joy . Confidence is not enough, and joy is the hard part. Definitions # This chapter # Confidence : Knowing what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. Knowing that your genitals are made of the same parts as everyone else\u2019s, organized in a unique way. Knowing about the brakes and accelerator. Knowing about context and about the difference between liking, wanting, and learning. Knowing about arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Knowing what\u2019s really true, even when it\u2019s not what you were taught \u201cshould\u201d be true. Knowing what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you wish were true. Joy : Loving what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. Loving your genitals, your brakes and accelerator, and the way your brain responds to context. Loving the context itself. Loving arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Loving what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you were taught \u201cshould\u201d be true. Loving what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you wish were true. Non-judge : Not categorizing your internal experience as good or bad, right or wrong. In other words, non-judging allows you to feel what you feel, whether or not it makes sense to you, whether or not it\u2019s comfortable, whether or not it\u2019s what you believe you should be feeling. Nonjudging is neutrally noticing your own internal states. With nonjudging, it doesn\u2019t matter how you feel; what matters is how you feel about how you feel. And the most wellness-promoting way to feel is\u2026 neutral. Script : Something that should be that way. The social messages are scripts . Map (Model) : An abstract representation of something that exists in reality. The social messages are maps . Other chapters # Negative feelings : Feelings like hate, angry, frustration, despair, disappoinment and shame. Normal and broken # Social meaning : You are like social messages says you should be. Which is totally imposible because many social messages are opposites. True meaning : Totally healthy, just same parts as everyone else, organized in a unique way. Everyone who is healthy (physical and mentally) is normal. Broken : Not normal , the social meaning. Ussually implies damaged, inadequate, or diseased. It\u2019s something wrong with you. Social messages # Includes moral, media and medical messages. Moral messages : You are evil. If you want or like sex, you\u2019re a slut. Your virginity is your most valuable asset. If you\u2019ve had too many partners (\u201ctoo many\u201d = more than your male partner has had), you should be ashamed. There is only one right way to behave and one right way to feel about sex\u2014not to feel anything about it at all but to accommodate the man to whom your body belongs. [\u2026] If you are sexually desirable, you are, by definition, unlovable, and a slut. Media messages : You are inadequate. Spanking, food play, m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois\u2026 you\u2019ve done all these things, right? Well, you\u2019ve at least had clitoral orgasms, vaginal orgasms, uterine orgasms, energy orgasms, extended orgasms, and multiple orgasms? And you\u2019ve mastered at least thirty-five different positions for intercourse? If you don\u2019t try all these things, you\u2019re frigid. If you\u2019ve had too few partners, don\u2019t watch porn, and don\u2019t have a collection of vibrators in your bedside table, you\u2019re a prude. Also: You\u2019re too fat and too thin; your breasts are too big and too small. Your body is wrong. If you\u2019re not trying to change it, you\u2019re lazy. If you\u2019re satisfied with yourself as you are, you\u2019re settling. And if you dare to actively like yourself, you\u2019re a conceited bitch. In short, you are doing it wrong. Do it differently. No, that\u2019s wrong, too, try something else. Forever. Medical messages : You are deseased. Sex causes disease and pregnancy, which makes it dangerous. But if you\u2019re ready to take that risk, sexual functioning should happen in a particular way\u2014desire, then arousal, then orgasm, preferably during intercourse, simultaneously with your partner\u2014and when it doesn\u2019t, there is a medical issue that you must address. Medically. With medication. Or possibly surgery. To the extent that a woman\u2019s sexual response differs from a man\u2019s, she is diseased\u2014except for pregnancy, which is what sex is for. Confidence: The map # Step 1: Analyce your sexuality # Ask yourself: What are my accelerators and brakes and how sensitives are they? What are my stressors and how sensitive they are? Which is my desire type? Do I have spontaneous, responsive or context-dependent desire? Does my genital response predicts my arousal? How much? How do I reach orgasm? Do I need clitoral stimulation? Tell yourself that whatever your answer is, you are normal. Your body is also normal. If you have a partner ask yourself what you think their responses would be. Then ask him/her to answer the questions. Let him/her know what your answers were. Step 2: Notice the gap # Your feelings are always true, so notice them. If you have negative feelings experiencing your sexuality probably it\u2019s your little monitor fault, noticing that the expectations you have for your goals are not being met. So close the gap by reality-check . This also applies to what you feel about your partner sexuality, i.e. you feel your partner should have \u201cmore\u201d\u2014Maybe you have spontaneous desire and you think your partner responsive desire as lesser (it\u2019s an opinion not a fact)\u2014sexual desire. Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual scripts . These scripts provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these scripts act as barriers between us and joy. Map and terrain metaphor # What would you say if a map doesn\u2019t match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes? Which is wrong, the map or the terrain? Everyone would probably say that it is the terrain that is wrong. But what if everyone says the map is right and it\u2019s the terrain you\u2019re looking at which\u2019s wrong? Our sexual scripts are our the map , and our experiences are our terrain. When our experiences don\u2019t match the map our brains try to make the map true, forcing our experience into the shape of the map . You feel your experiences should match the map , i.e. a gap. That is why the litte monitor activates. The first step toward joy is recognizing a mismatch between the map and the terrain, with the knowledge that the terrain is always right. Once you recognize this mismatch, you have to draw a new map grounded on science and your own experience. Why confidence is not enough? # Because maybe you already know what is true about yourself (and about your partner) but you don\u2019t accept it. So you hit your brakes . Scripts aren\u2019t about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it. There are some ways that may make you struggle reaching joy : To think of yourself as lesser. A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that \u2018responsive desire\u2019 is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire. Most women have \u201ca lesser desire?\u201d Yeowch. The construction of responsive desire as \u201clesser\u201d is not a \u201cfact,\u201d of course; it\u2019s a value judgment, an opinion. Solution : Notice that it\u2019s an opinion not a fact. Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are broken . The worst case is when these people are people you love. Solution : Trust you and science, not social messages . To have negative feelings about what is true of yourself, for being as you are. Solution : Don\u2019t lock up those feelings, address them by non-judging . complete the stress cycle . Link your personality to one of those social messages . Smart womens don\u2019t want sex. Smart girls are interested in minds, not bodies; only stupid girls are ruled by their \u201cbase animal instincts.\u201d Solution : Notice you are just playing a role. People are always playing roles (as partner, parent, child, uncle, student, employee, boss, etc.\u2014You even behave differently with different groups of friends). But you are not the role you are playing, you are not even the role you play being alone. Everyone is free; so you don\u2019t have to play a role you have been playing. You probably didn\u2019t consciously choosen that role and it\u2019s just an absurd social message . Joy : The hard part # You sense, that sensesations generate a feeling, then you judge that feeling based on your beliefs and expectations\u2014that\u2019s your litte monitor . Step 3: How you feel about how you feel? # Once you have confidence and you had drawn a new map , how do you feel about what your map (your sexuality) is like? You may have negative feelings about it. Negative feelings hurts, so people ussually lock them deep inside themselves, without completing the stress cycle and not healing themselves. Whenever you notice a negative feeling ask yourself (don\u2019t lock it): How I feel? Which negative feeling it is? What is making me feel this way? What are my thoughts about it? Am I judging it? On what belief or expectative do I base my judgment? It is this belief true? Do reality-check and heal that feeling by completing the stress cycle . Step 4: How to non-judge ? # The definition is above . What is the non-judging for? Non-judging can help in: Feelings that happen for \u201cno good reason\u201d. Healing trauma. Resolving pain. Increasing pleasure. Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d. Non-judging is so good because helps to completing the stress cycle . I used to think that it was the awareness of your internal state that mattered, but in study after study, \u201cobservation\u201d of internal state is not a significant predictor of wellbeing. Instead, the most important variable is \u201cnon-judging\u201d. Non-judge # Feelings that happen for \u201cno good reason\u201d # You have stress about something you can\u2019t do anything about\u2014A bad new you see on TV, your favorite character of the book you are reading dies, something that reminds you of something bad from the past, etc.\u2014so you can\u2019t complete the stress cycle easily fleeing or fighting, because you are not there. Let you feel your feeling by non-judging and tell yourself \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I can\u2019t do anything about it, so don\u2019t make sense to feel that way\u201d . When we have feelings we can\u2019t really do anything about and we don\u2019t know how to let ourselves simply feel without doing anything, our brains will look for some situation it can do something about, and it will try to impose the feelings on that situation. I.e. You feel angry with the result of the football match so you yell at your son at the slightest thing you can scold him about. Healing a trauma # A trauma is a wound in your mind. And like a wound in the body, it causes pain, but emotional pain, not physical pain. The pain is part of the healing process. But if you numb your physical pain, healing can still happen. Alas, if we try to \u201cnumb\u201d your emotional pain, we get a break from the pain\u2026 but the healing is put on pause. For healing a trauma you have to let yourself feel what you feel without lock those feelings. This ussually implies suffering and patience, maybe months. Someone described this process like: \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 I\u2019m sitting with a stunned bird in the palm of my hand. If I get tense and try to hurry it, it will just stay frozen. But if I\u2019m still and patient long enough, the bird will wake up and fly away.\u201d Resolving pain # First you need to know: Pain is not normal. \u00a1Never! All pain is created in the brain, in response to the body\u2019s signals that there is some kind of threat. Pain is a signal that your brain perceives a threat, and you might need help. If you use your own internal experience, rather than culturally imposed criterion velocities, as your most accurate source of knowledge about sex, you\u2019ll be able to hear your brain\u2019s signal that you need help, and you\u2019ll take it seriously. Many people don\u2019t take pain seriusly, and this is mainly due to social messages like: Pain in sex is normal. Pain in sex is pleasure. Pain is part of the life. Don\u2019t complain, get over it. Mentally strong people do not complain. Have a glass of wine and relax. Ladies like a bit of pain. Girls like rough sex. Girls are sexy when they scream. If there is no infection or injury, the pain is \u201call in her head.\u201d ( medical message ) Any unwanted pain is not normal. Our willingness to tolerate greater effort\u2014in this case, pain\u2014is learned. And it can be changed, simply by becoming aware of it and allowing the possibility that it could be different. Be aware thay you feel pain and tell youserlf \u201cPain is not normal. I don\u2019t have to deal with pain. There are solutions. I will seek for a solution\u201d. This is as literal as it gets: It\u2019s not how you feel (pain). It\u2019s how you feel (tolerant or not) about how you feel. Non-judgin doesn\u2019t mean resignation. It means turning toward what\u2019s true with kindness, without self-criticism. With non-judging, you can ask for help. See pain causes . Increasing pleasure # Pleasure is the hardest part, because there are many social messages about it and they are laden with \u201cshoulds\u201d and negative feelings . Many of us have been taught that pleasure is selfish, sinful, a waste of time, or something to be ashamed of. How dare we attend to what feels good, when we ought to be attending to other people\u2019s needs or our partner or making sure we meet other people\u2019s expectations? Too many peoble make their choices based not on what they like, but on what they believe their partner likes or what they\u2019ve been told they \u201cshould\u201d like. So how can I allow myself to enjoy the pleasure? Practice non-judging when you feel pleasure and tell yourself: Pleasure is normal. Feel pleasure is ok. My pleasure come first, then others. I don\u2019t have to act as social messages says. Someone said: \u201cI can\u2019t be a source of joy in the lives of the people I love if I can\u2019t even be a source of joy for myself.\u201d By not judging, you allow yourself to experience pleasure and enhance it, leading you straight to ectasis. This is a strange truth about nonjudgment. When you turn toward suffering with nonjudgment, the suffering diminishes as wounds heal. When you turn toward pleasure with nonjudgment, it expands to all the space judgment once filled. That happens because you brain has a processing capacity. If you spend part of it judging, you can\u2019t devote all your capacity to healing or pleasure. But here is the truth: Pleasure is a gateway to accessing your fullest, truest personhood. Pleasure is where you find a no-holds-barred connection with yourself and with those you love most. Why? Because pleasure only happens in a context where your brain feels safe enough to be completely and entirely you, without shame or social performance or \u201cshoulds.\u201d Ecstasy comes to us when we leave behind everything that doesn\u2019t delight us or spark our curiosity. Ecstasy comes when we surrender to pleasure without reservation. You are allowed to like pleasure. Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d # For some people knowing what is true (confidence) is enough to set them free from the myths of social messages . Others also need to notice their judgmental feelings so they can release those social messages by non-judging . But for others (the worst case) notice their judgmental feelings is not enough to free themselves from those social messages . Why? Many of our goals (the \u201cshoulds\u201d) in lives, have been imposed on us through the social messages \u2014especially in sexuality because it is so taboo\u2014, so release those myths from social messages is to say to your litte monitor \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry but I give up, it\u2019s imposible\u201d . And you already know how your little monitor reacts to this, with awful feelings (the worst of the negative feelings ), it\u2019s the ultimate disappointment for the little monitor , you feel like a complete failure. You have given up what you were taught was the right map . Many of these social messages are so deep in our minds that we had built our personalities based on them. That\u2019s why reach joy becomes so difficult for many people, because free themselves from those social messages implies a failture and leave behind part of his personality. You are pulling up all the weeds (poisonous goals and beliefs) from your mental garden (your mind), which happened to be most of the plants, leaving it almost deserted. It hurts so much. The way to get through is to stay very still, to notice all the aspects of your identity that were tied to the lies you were told, to notice all the grief you feel in letting go of the self you spent your life trying to be. Notice, too, the anger you feel at having been lied to for so long. Notice all of these with nonjudgment. Allow them to be true. Emotions are tunnels: You have to go through the darkness to get to the light at the end. Sometimes that\u2019s fairly easy, but sometimes it hurts like hell. Sometimes letting go of a particular goal feels like you have to let go of your entire identity. It\u2019s not an easy process; parts of it are downright uncomfortable. But it\u2019s so, so worth it, because at the end of the tunnel is the ultimate reward: you.","title":"Chapter 9: Love what is true"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True/#chapter-9-love-what-is-true","text":"This chapter is about how to reach the ecstasy through confidence and joy in whole you.

All pain is created in the brain, in response to the body\u2019s signals that there is some kind of threat. Pain is a signal that your brain perceives a threat, and you might need help. If you use your own internal experience, rather than culturally imposed criterion velocities, as your most accurate source of knowledge about sex, you\u2019ll be able to hear your brain\u2019s signal that you need help, and you\u2019ll take it seriously. Many people don\u2019t take pain seriusly, and this is mainly due to social messages like: Pain in sex is normal. Pain in sex is pleasure. Pain is part of the life. Don\u2019t complain, get over it. Mentally strong people do not complain. Have a glass of wine and relax. Ladies like a bit of pain. Girls like rough sex. Girls are sexy when they scream. If there is no infection or injury, the pain is \u201call in her head.\u201d ( medical message ) Any unwanted pain is not normal. Our willingness to tolerate greater effort\u2014in this case, pain\u2014is learned. And it can be changed, simply by becoming aware of it and allowing the possibility that it could be different. Be aware thay you feel pain and tell youserlf \u201cPain is not normal. I don\u2019t have to deal with pain. There are solutions. I will seek for a solution\u201d. This is as literal as it gets: It\u2019s not how you feel (pain). It\u2019s how you feel (tolerant or not) about how you feel. Non-judgin doesn\u2019t mean resignation.

Many of us have been taught that pleasure is selfish, sinful, a waste of time, or something to be ashamed of. How dare we attend to what feels good, when we ought to be attending to other people\u2019s needs or our partner or making sure we meet other people\u2019s expectations? Too many peoble make their choices based not on what they like, but on what they believe their partner likes or what they\u2019ve been told they \u201cshould\u201d like. So how can I allow myself to enjoy the pleasure? Practice non-judging when you feel pleasure and tell yourself: Pleasure is normal. Feel pleasure is ok. My pleasure come first, then others. I don\u2019t have to act as social messages says. Someone said: \u201cI can\u2019t be a source of joy in the lives of the people I love if I can\u2019t even be a source of joy for myself.\u201d By not judging, you allow yourself to experience pleasure and enhance it, leading you straight to ectasis. This is a strange truth about nonjudgment. When you turn toward suffering with nonjudgment, the suffering diminishes as wounds heal. When you turn toward pleasure with nonjudgment, it expands to all the space judgment once filled. That happens because you brain has a processing capacity. If you spend part of it judging, you can\u2019t devote all your capacity to healing or pleasure. But here is the truth: Pleasure is a gateway to accessing your fullest, truest personhood. Pleasure is where you find a no-holds-barred connection with yourself and with those you love most. Why? Because pleasure only happens in a context where your brain feels safe enough to be completely and entirely you, without shame or social performance or \u201cshoulds.\u201d Ecstasy comes to us when we leave behind everything that doesn\u2019t delight us or spark our curiosity. Ecstasy comes when we surrender to pleasure without reservation. You are allowed to like pleasure.","title":"Increasing pleasure"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True/#mourning-the-shoulds","text":"For some people knowing what is true (confidence) is enough to set them free from the myths of social messages . Others also need to notice their judgmental feelings so they can release those social messages by non-judging . But for others (the worst case) notice their judgmental feelings is not enough to free themselves from those social messages . Why? Many of our goals (the \u201cshoulds\u201d) in lives, have been imposed on us through the social messages \u2014especially in sexuality because it is so taboo\u2014, so release those myths from social messages is to say to your litte monitor \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry but I give up, it\u2019s imposible\u201d .

You have given up what you were taught was the right map . Many of these social messages are so deep in our minds that we had built our personalities based on them. That\u2019s why reach joy becomes so difficult for many people, because free themselves from those social messages implies a failture and leave behind part of his personality. You are pulling up all the weeds (poisonous goals and beliefs) from your mental garden (your mind), which happened to be most of the plants, leaving it almost deserted. It hurts so much. The way to get through is to stay very still, to notice all the aspects of your identity that were tied to the lies you were told, to notice all the grief you feel in letting go of the self you spent your life trying to be. Notice, too, the anger you feel at having been lied to for so long. Notice all of these with nonjudgment. Allow them to be true. Emotions are tunnels: You have to go through the darkness to get to the light at the end. Sometimes that\u2019s fairly easy, but sometimes it hurts like hell. Sometimes letting go of a particular goal feels like you have to let go of your entire identity. It\u2019s not an easy process; parts of it are downright uncomfortable.
