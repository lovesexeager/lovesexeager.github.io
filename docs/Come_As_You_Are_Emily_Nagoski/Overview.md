### Why I do this summary? 

Because this book is absolutely awesome, a masterpiece, I love it. 

After reading it twice I felt the need to have a good **structured summary**, in which to **relate concepts** that appear in the book. 

I thought that links to a web page could be a very good way to do this. So I decided to make this summary in wiki format. And that's how this website was born.   

People need to know what this book has to say.
