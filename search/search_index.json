Medically. With medication. Or possibly surgery. To the extent that a woman\u2019s sexual response differs from a man\u2019s, she is diseased\u2014except for pregnancy, which is what sex is for. Confidence: The map # Step 1: Analyze your sexuality # Ask yourself: What are my accelerators and brakes and how sensitives are they? What are my stressors and how sensitive they are? Which is my desire type? Do I have spontaneous, responsive or context-dependent desire? Does my genital response predict my arousal? How much? How do I reach orgasm? Do I need clitoral stimulation? Tell yourself that whatever your answer is, you are normal. Your body is also normal. If you have a partner ask yourself what you think their responses would be. Then ask him/her to answer the questions. Let him/her know what your answers were. Step 2: Notice the gap # Your feelings are always true, so notice them. If you have negative feelings experiencing your sexuality probably it\u2019s your little monitor fault, noticing that the expectations you have for your goals are not being met. So close the gap by reality-check . This also applies to what you feel about your partner sexuality, i.e. you feel your partner should have \u201cmore\u201d\u2014Maybe you have spontaneous desire and you think your partner responsive desire as lesser (it\u2019s an opinion not a fact)\u2014sexual desire. Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual scripts . These scripts provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these scripts act as barriers between us and joy. Map and terrain metaphor # What would you say if a map doesn\u2019t match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes? Which is wrong, the map or the terrain? Everyone would probably say that it is the terrain that is wrong. But what if everyone says the map is right and it\u2019s the terrain you\u2019re looking at which\u2019s wrong? Our sexual scripts are our the map , and our experiences are our terrain. When our experiences don\u2019t match the map our brains try to make the map true, forcing our experience into the shape of the map . You feel your experiences should match the map , i.e. a gap. That is why the little monitor activates. The first step toward joy is to recognize a mismatch between the map and the terrain, with the knowledge that the terrain is always right. Once you recognize this mismatch, you have to draw a new map grounded on science and your own experience. Why confidence is not enough? # Because maybe you already know what is true about yourself (and about your partner) but you don\u2019t accept it. So you hit your brakes . Scripts aren\u2019t about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it. There are some ways that may make you struggle to reach joy : To think of yourself as lesser. A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that \u2018responsive desire\u2019 is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire. Most women have \u201ca lesser desire?\u201d Yeowch. The construction of responsive desire as \u201clesser\u201d is not a \u201cfact,\u201d of course; it\u2019s a value judgment, an opinion. Solution : Notice that it\u2019s an opinion not a fact. Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are broken . The worst case is when these people are people you love. Solution : Trust you and science, not social messages . To have negative feelings about what is true of yourself, for being as you are. Solution : Don\u2019t lock up those feelings, address them by non-judging . Complete the stress cycle . Link your personality to one of those social messages . Smart women don\u2019t want sex. Smart girls are interested in minds, not bodies; only stupid girls are ruled by their \u201cbase animal instincts.\u201d Solution : Notice you are just playing a role. People are always playing roles (as partner, parent, child, uncle, student, employee, boss, etc.\u2014You even behave differently with different groups of friends). But you are not the role you are playing, you are not even the role you play being alone. Everyone is free; so you don\u2019t have to play a role you have been playing. You probably didn\u2019t consciously chosen that role and it\u2019s just an absurd social message . Joy : The hard part # You sense, that sensations generate a feeling, then you judge that feeling based on your beliefs and expectations\u2014that\u2019s your little monitor . Step 3: How you feel about how you feel? # Once you have confidence and you had drawn a new map , how do you feel about what your map (your sexuality) is like? You may have negative feelings about it. Negative feelings hurts, so people usually lock them deep inside themselves, without completing the stress cycle and not healing themselves. Whenever you notice a negative feeling ask yourself (don\u2019t lock it): How I feel? Which negative feeling it is? What is making me feel this way? What are my thoughts about it? Am I judging it? On what belief or expectation do I base my judgment? It is this belief true? Do reality-check and heal that feeling by completing the stress cycle . Step 4: How to non-judge ? # The definition is above . What is the non-judging for? Non-judging can help in: Feelings that happen for \u201cno good reason\u201d. Healing trauma. Resolving pain. Increasing pleasure. Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d. Non-judging is so good because helps to completing the stress cycle . I used to think that it was the awareness of your internal state that mattered, but in study after study, \u201cobservation\u201d of internal state is not a significant predictor of wellbeing. Instead, the most important variable is \u201cnon-judging\u201d. Non-judge # Feelings that happen for \u201cno good reason\u201d # You have stress about something you can\u2019t do anything about\u2014A bad new you see on TV, your favorite character of the book you are reading dies, something that reminds you of something bad from the past, etc.\u2014so you can\u2019t complete the stress cycle easily fleeing or fighting, because you are not there. Let you feel your feeling by non-judging and tell yourself \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I can\u2019t do anything about it, so don\u2019t make sense to feel that way\u201d . When we have feelings we can\u2019t really do anything about, and we don\u2019t know how to let ourselves simply feel without doing anything, our brains will look for some situation it can do something about, and it will try to impose the feelings on that situation. I.e. You feel angry with the result of the football match so you yell at your son at the slightest thing you can scold him about. Healing a trauma # A trauma is a wound in your mind. And like a wound in the body, it causes pain, but emotional pain, not physical pain. The pain is part of the healing process. But if you numb your physical pain, healing can still happen. Alas, if we try to \u201cnumb\u201d your emotional pain, we get a break from the pain\u2026 but the healing is put on pause. For healing a trauma you have to let yourself feel what you feel without lock those feelings. This usually implies suffering and patience, maybe months. Someone described this process like: \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 I\u2019m sitting with a stunned bird in the palm of my hand. If I get tense and try to hurry it, it will just stay frozen. But if I\u2019m still and patient long enough, the bird will wake up and fly away.\u201d Resolving pain # First you need to know: Pain is not normal. \u00a1Never! All pain is created in the brain, in response to the body\u2019s signals that there is some kind of threat. Pain is a signal that your brain perceives a threat, and you might need help. If you use your own internal experience, rather than culturally imposed criterion velocities, as your most accurate source of knowledge about sex, you\u2019ll be able to hear your brain\u2019s signal that you need help, and you\u2019ll take it seriously. Many people don\u2019t take pain seriously, and this is mainly due to social messages like: Pain in sex is normal. Pain in sex is pleasure. Pain is part of the life. Don\u2019t complain, get over it. Mentally strong people do not complain. Have a glass of wine and relax. Ladies like a bit of pain. Girls like rough sex. Girls are sexy when they scream. If there is no infection or injury, the pain is \u201call in her head.\u201d ( medical message ) Any unwanted pain is not normal. Our willingness to tolerate greater effort\u2014in this case, pain\u2014is learned. And it can be changed, simply by becoming aware of it and allowing the possibility that it could be different. Be aware that you feel pain and tell yourself \u201cPain is not normal. I don\u2019t have to deal with pain. There are solutions. I will seek for a solution\u201d. This is as literal as it gets: It\u2019s not how you feel (pain). It\u2019s how you feel (tolerant or not) about how you feel. Non-judging doesn\u2019t mean resignation. It means turning toward what\u2019s true with kindness, without self-criticism. With non-judging, you can ask for help. See pain causes . Increasing pleasure # Pleasure is the hardest part, because there are many social messages about it, and they are laden with \u201cshoulds\u201d and negative feelings . Many of us have been taught that pleasure is selfish, sinful, a waste of time, or something to be ashamed of. How dare we attend to what feels good, when we ought to be attending to other people\u2019s needs or our partner or making sure we meet other people\u2019s expectations? Too many people make their choices based not on what they like, but on what they believe their partner likes or what they\u2019ve been told they \u201cshould\u201d like. So how can I allow myself to enjoy the pleasure? Practice non-judging when you feel pleasure and tell yourself: Pleasure is normal. Feel pleasure is ok. My pleasure come first, then others. I don\u2019t have to act as social messages says. Someone said: \u201cI can\u2019t be a source of joy in the lives of the people I love if I can\u2019t even be a source of joy for myself.\u201d By not judging, you allow yourself to experience pleasure and enhance it, leading you straight to ecstasy. This is a strange truth about non-judgment. When you turn toward suffering with non-judgment, the suffering diminishes as wounds heal. When you turn toward pleasure with non-judgment, it expands to all the space judgment once filled. That happens because you brain has a processing capacity. If you spend part of it judging, you can\u2019t devote all your capacity to healing or pleasure. But here is the truth: Pleasure is a gateway to accessing your fullest, truest personhood. Pleasure is where you find a no-holds-barred connection with yourself and with those you love most. Why? Because pleasure only happens in a context where your brain feels safe enough to be completely and entirely you, without shame or social performance or \u201cshoulds.\u201d Ecstasy comes to us when we leave behind everything that doesn\u2019t delight us or spark our curiosity. Ecstasy comes when we surrender to pleasure without reservation. You are allowed to like pleasure. Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d # For some people knowing what is true (confidence) is enough to set them free from the myths of social messages . Others also need to notice their judgmental feelings, so they can release those social messages by non-judging . But for others (the worst case) notice their judgmental feelings is not enough to free themselves from those social messages . Why? Many of our goals (the \u201cshoulds\u201d) in lives, have been imposed on us through the social messages \u2014especially in sexuality because it is so taboo\u2014, so release those myths from social messages is to say to your little monitor \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry but I give up, it\u2019s impossible\u201d . And you already know how your little monitor reacts to this, with awful feelings (the worst of the negative feelings ), it\u2019s the ultimate disappointment for the little monitor , you feel like a complete failure. You have given up what you were taught was the right map . Many of these social messages are so deep in our minds that we had built our personalities based on them. That\u2019s why reach joy becomes so difficult for many people, because free themselves from those social messages implies a failure and leave behind part of his personality. You are pulling up all the weeds (poisonous goals and beliefs) from your mental garden (your mind), which happened to be most of the plants, leaving it almost deserted. It hurts so much. The way to get through is to stay very still, to notice all the aspects of your identity that were tied to the lies you were told, to notice all the grief you feel in letting go of the self you spent your life trying to be. Notice, too, the anger you feel at having been lied to for so long. Notice all of these with non-judgment. Allow them to be true. Emotions are tunnels: You have to go through the darkness to get to the light at the end. Sometimes that\u2019s fairly easy, but sometimes it hurts like hell. Sometimes letting go of a particular goal feels like you have to let go of your entire identity. It\u2019s not an easy process; parts of it are downright uncomfortable. But it\u2019s so, so worth it, because at the end of the tunnel is the ultimate reward: you. To feel normal # You belongs # What do you think your goal is? Is it pleasure? Connection with her partner? Self-discovery? For most people the main goal is to feel \u201c normal \u201d (the social meaning). But there is no such a thing like \u201c normal \u201d, because we all are normal (the real meaning). What people really aim by being \u201c normal \u201d is to feel that they belong , we are social beings. If you feel that you don\u2019t belong you feel lost, what implies risk and insecurity. We want to know that we are safe within the bounds of shared human experience, that what\u2019s on our map is the same as what is on other people\u2019s maps. When people ask me, \u201cAm I normal?\u201d they\u2019re asking, \u201cDo I belong?\u201d \u2003The answer is yes. You belong in your body. You belong in the world. You\u2019ve belonged since the day you were born, this is your home. You don\u2019t have to earn it by conforming to some externally imposed sexual standard. \u2003If you change your goal from \u201cnormal\u201d to \u201cwherever I belong,\u201d then you\u2019re always successful because you\u2019re already there. This is it # You are as you are now, this is it. For many years, I kept a small comic taped to my office door. It shows an old Buddhist monk sitting next to a young Buddhist monk. The older monk is saying, \u201cNothing happens next. This is it.\u201d \u2003Being more nerd than nun, I see it as a commentary on the discrepancy-reducing feedback loop and criterion velocity, on the importance of training your little monitor to enjoy the present rather than constantly push toward the future. What if\u2026 this is a radical idea, but just go with me: What if you felt that way\u2014\u201cThis is it\u201d\u2014about your sexual functioning? What if the sexuality you have right now is the sexuality you get? What if this is it? If you have negative feeling noticing that \u201cthis is it\u201d, you are feeling the gap between your goal of \u201c normal \u201d (social meaning) and how you are. But remember that you are already normal (the real meaning). See Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d Not your fault but your responsibility # Culture has planted weeds in our mental garden with social messages from a young age, shaping what we believe to be \u201cnormal\u201d (social meaning). So it is our job to pull out the weeds. Even though it is not our fault, is your responsibility. You are already normal (real meaning). The day you were born, the world had a choice about what to teach you about your body. It could have taught you to live with confidence and joy inside your body. It could have taught you that your body and your sexuality are beautiful gifts. But instead, the world taught you to feel critical of and dissatisfied with your sexuality and your body. You were taught to value and expect something from your sexuality that does not match what your sexuality actually is. You were told a story about what would happen in your sexual life, and that story was false. You were lied to.","title":"Chapter 9: Love what is true"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True/#chapter-9-love-what-is-true","text":"This chapter is about how to reach the ecstasy through confidence and joy in whole you.

Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual scripts . These scripts provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these scripts act as barriers between us and joy.","title":"Step 2: Notice the gap"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True/#map-and-terrain-metaphor","text":"What would you say if a map doesn\u2019t match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes?

They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it. There are some ways that may make you struggle to reach joy : To think of yourself as lesser. A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that \u2018responsive desire\u2019 is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire. Most women have \u201ca lesser desire?\u201d Yeowch. The construction of responsive desire as \u201clesser\u201d is not a \u201cfact,\u201d of course; it\u2019s a value judgment, an opinion. Solution : Notice that it\u2019s an opinion not a fact. Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are broken . The worst case is when these people are people you love. Solution : Trust you and science, not social messages . To have negative feelings about what is true of yourself, for being as you are. Solution : Don\u2019t lock up those feelings, address them by non-judging . Complete the stress cycle . Link your personality to one of those social messages . Smart women don\u2019t want sex. Smart girls are interested in minds, not bodies; only stupid girls are ruled by their \u201cbase animal instincts.\u201d Solution : Notice you are just playing a role. People are always playing roles (as partner, parent, child, uncle, student, employee, boss, etc.\u2014You even behave differently with different groups of friends). But you are not the role you are playing, you are not even the role you play being alone. Everyone is free; so you don\u2019t have to play a role you have been playing.

Many people don\u2019t take pain seriously, and this is mainly due to social messages like: Pain in sex is normal. Pain in sex is pleasure. Pain is part of the life. Don\u2019t complain, get over it. Mentally strong people do not complain. Have a glass of wine and relax. Ladies like a bit of pain. Girls like rough sex. Girls are sexy when they scream.

Many of us have been taught that pleasure is selfish, sinful, a waste of time, or something to be ashamed of. How dare we attend to what feels good, when we ought to be attending to other people\u2019s needs or our partner or making sure we meet other people\u2019s expectations? Too many people make their choices based not on what they like, but on what they believe their partner likes or what they\u2019ve been told they \u201cshould\u201d like. So how can I allow myself to enjoy the pleasure? Practice non-judging when you feel pleasure and tell yourself: Pleasure is normal. Feel pleasure is ok. My pleasure come first, then others. I don\u2019t have to act as social messages says. Someone said: \u201cI can\u2019t be a source of joy in the lives of the people I love if I can\u2019t even be a source of joy for myself.\u201d By not judging, you allow yourself to experience pleasure and enhance it, leading you straight to ecstasy. This is a strange truth about non-judgment. When you turn toward suffering with non-judgment, the suffering diminishes as wounds heal. When you turn toward pleasure with non-judgment, it expands to all the space judgment once filled. That happens because you brain has a processing capacity. If you spend part of it judging, you can\u2019t devote all your capacity to healing or pleasure. But here is the truth: Pleasure is a gateway to accessing your fullest, truest personhood. Pleasure is where you find a no-holds-barred connection with yourself and with those you love most. Why? Because pleasure only happens in a context where your brain feels safe enough to be completely and entirely you, without shame or social performance or \u201cshoulds.\u201d Ecstasy comes to us when we leave behind everything that doesn\u2019t delight us or spark our curiosity.

Many of our goals (the \u201cshoulds\u201d) in lives, have been imposed on us through the social messages \u2014especially in sexuality because it is so taboo\u2014, so release those myths from social messages is to say to your little monitor \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry but I give up, it\u2019s impossible\u201d .

You are pulling up all the weeds (poisonous goals and beliefs) from your mental garden (your mind), which happened to be most of the plants, leaving it almost deserted. It hurts so much. The way to get through is to stay very still, to notice all the aspects of your identity that were tied to the lies you were told, to notice all the grief you feel in letting go of the self you spent your life trying to be. Notice, too, the anger you feel at having been lied to for so long. Notice all of these with non-judgment. Allow them to be true. Emotions are tunnels: You have to go through the darkness to get to the light at the end. Sometimes that\u2019s fairly easy, but sometimes it hurts like hell. Sometimes letting go of a particular goal feels like you have to let go of your entire identity. It\u2019s not an easy process; parts of it are downright uncomfortable.

She allowed herself to be a woman who doesn\u2019t want sex to release the pressure she was under. This way she was capable of enjoying sex without pressure. Am Im putting in the right amount of the rigth kind of effort? # In chapter 8, when Olivia meditated her way to an extended orgasm, she was practicing being present as she was, rather than pushing forward to some goal. She kept the same goal\u2014ecstasy\u2014but she changed the kind of effort she was investing. From quick sex to reach orgasm to slow sex for enjoyment and ecstasy, achieving longer-lasting and better orgasms. And in chapter 7, when Merritt, instead of trying on the aspirational identity of a woman who loves sex, embraced the identity of a woman who did not want sex, she was changing the kind of effort she invested, to attain her goal of trusting herself. The result was not sinking down forever into a state of not wanting sex\u2014on the contrary! Allowing herself to be where she was opened the door to where she wanted to go. From striving to want to be a woman who likes sex to striving to trust herself. Are my expectations of how much effort this particular goal requires realistic? # Since Ms. B. entered her mid-40s, she says, sex has been more about smoke and mirrors than thunder and lightning. She is rarely if ever interested enough to initiate it with her partner of 10 years, and she does not reach climax during the act. She wishes it were otherwise. Having gotten this far in the book, you\u2019ll recognize that Ms. B.\u2019s desire style may be responsive rather than spontaneous, and it sounds like she\u2019s not reliably orgasmic with intercourse. Both of these put her squarely in the majority. The expectations she had about how much effort it takes to reach orgasm by intercourse without clitoral stimulation was unrealistic. Chasing dynamic # What says, \u201cYou are awesome in bed!\u201d more clearly than your partner\u2019s orgasm? \u2003Your partner not being able to stop themselves from having an orgasm\u2014especially if that partner has a slightly stubborn accelerator. \u2003Camilla thought through the \u201cIf I make you a pizza and you only eat one slice, how does that make me feel?\u201d problem logically and came to a smart conclusion: \u2003They made a rule against her having orgasm. \u2003They could do anything else they wanted, but Camilla wasn\u2019t allowed to have any orgasms. It\u2019s a reverse psychology trick that you\u2019d never expect to work in real life\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have an orgasm? Fine. You\u2019re not allowed to have an orgasm!\u201d\u2014but it actually does. \u2003| The rule did two things. First, it genuinely took away performance pressure from Camilla and frustrated expectations from Henry. They could both relax and forget about it, which made them both feel better. \u2003It had another impact, too. Henry had already shifted the way he thought about foreplay and was thinking of their entire relationship as an opportunity to tease Camilla\u2019s ticking pilot light. The new rule took that to \u2003another level. \u2003See, taking orgasm off the table put Camilla\u2019s little monitor in a puzzling situation. If Henry was, say, going down on her, and she felt so aroused that she thought she might have an orgasm, she\u2019d remember that she wasn\u2019t supposed to have an orgasm, and then the little monitor would keep checking her arousal level and comparing it with her goal state of not having an orgasm, which means her monitor would keep thinking about orgasm and how close she was to it. \u2003Embedded in the thought \u201cDon\u2019t have an orgasm\u201d is \u201c\u2026 have an orgasm.\u201d\u201d And if I say to you, \u201cDon\u2019t think about a bear,\u201d what\u2019s the first thing that happens? \u2003Orgasms aren\u2019t as automatic as thoughts, but in the right, sex-positive context, if you make orgasm against the rules and then give the person a lot of time to try not to have an orgasm\u2026 I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s a fun game and you might want to try it sometime. \u2003Which brings me to the orgasm your partner can\u2019t stop themselves from having. \u2003Henry is just about as smart as Camilla. I know this because one day she called me and said that he had stuck to their agreement better than she had\u2014he was using a vibrator on her and she had been close and actually wanted to have an orgasm, but he stopped before she got there. \u2003She was frustrated. And even a little pissed. But hey, the rule was her idea. He was being a gentleman. \u2003He did this two more times\u2014got her close, then backed off. \u2003Because he is such a gentleman. \u2003And eventually he got her so close that she genuinely couldn\u2019t stop herself from having an orgasm. Which is a neat trick\u2014women don\u2019t have a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d for orgasm the way men do for ejaculation. To get a woman to be unable to stop herself from coming takes a high level of persistent arousal. \u2003And yes, again, being a sex educator is the best job in the world when people tell you stories like this. Pleasure # Some one said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to feel good when so much of the world is such a mess\u201d. Solution : Pleasure is not a sin.

Life is complicated and Laurie still has times when she gets sucked into exhaustion and overwhelm, times when her body seems to shut out all potential sources of pleasure. But three things changed permanently. \u2003First, she practiced paying nonjudgmental attention to sensations, which taught her to be as kind and generous with herself as she was with everyone else she loved. She learned to notice and celebrate pleasure and joy, granting herself permission to feel good. \u2003Second, though there wasn\u2019t much she could do to reduce the actualstressors in her life, she reduced her stress by taking more deliberate effort to decompress and complete the stress response cycles that life activated. She let herself cry. She slowed down her showers, paid attention to the sensation of the water on her skin, and instead of slapping on body lotion like she was greasing a loaf pan, she paid attention to how nice it felt and how healthy her skin was. As she exercised, she visualized her stress as that orange monster in the Bugs Bunny cartoon\u2014the one Bugs gives a manicure\u2014and imagines herself running away from the monster, through her front door, and into Johnny\u2019s arms. She started experiencing the discharge of stress as pleasurable\u2014or at least not a source of suffering. \u2003And finally, she became much gentler with herself when she noticed herself being self-critical about her body or feeling guilty about pleasure. She didn\u2019t say to herself, \u201cStop it!\u201d She just thought, \u201cYup. There are the self- critical thoughts again.\u201d She practiced nonjudgment. Habits : Non-judge .

And in chapter 7, when Merritt, instead of trying on the aspirational identity of a woman who loves sex, embraced the identity of a woman who did not want sex, she was changing the kind of effort she invested, to attain her goal of trusting herself. The result was not sinking down forever into a state of not wanting sex\u2014on the contrary! Allowing herself to be where she was opened the door to where she wanted to go. From striving to want to be a woman who likes sex to striving to trust herself.","title":"Am Im putting in the right amount of the rigth kind of effort?"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/True_Stories/#are-my-expectations-of-how-much-effort-this-particular-goal-requires-realistic","text":"Since Ms. B. entered her mid-40s, she says, sex has been more about smoke and mirrors than thunder and lightning. She is rarely if ever interested enough to initiate it with her partner of 10 years, and she does not reach climax during the act. She wishes it were otherwise. Having gotten this far in the book, you\u2019ll recognize that Ms. B.\u2019s desire style may be responsive rather than spontaneous, and it sounds like she\u2019s not reliably orgasmic with intercourse. Both of these put her squarely in the majority. The expectations she had about how much effort it takes to reach orgasm by intercourse without clitoral stimulation was unrealistic.","title":"Are my expectations of how much effort this particular goal requires realistic?"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/True_Stories/#chasing-dynamic","text":"What says, \u201cYou are awesome in bed!\u201d more clearly than your partner\u2019s orgasm? \u2003Your partner not being able to stop themselves from having an orgasm\u2014especially if that partner has a slightly stubborn accelerator. \u2003Camilla thought through the \u201cIf I make you a pizza and you only eat one slice, how does that make me feel?\u201d problem logically and came to a smart conclusion: \u2003They made a rule against her having orgasm. \u2003They could do anything else they wanted, but Camilla wasn\u2019t allowed to have any orgasms. It\u2019s a reverse psychology trick that you\u2019d never expect to work in real life\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have an orgasm? Fine. You\u2019re not allowed to have an orgasm!\u201d\u2014but it actually does. \u2003| The rule did two things. First, it genuinely took away performance pressure from Camilla and frustrated expectations from Henry. They could both relax and forget about it, which made them both feel better. \u2003It had another impact, too. Henry had already shifted the way he thought about foreplay and was thinking of their entire relationship as an opportunity to tease Camilla\u2019s ticking pilot light. The new rule took that to \u2003another level. \u2003See, taking orgasm off the table put Camilla\u2019s little monitor in a puzzling situation. If Henry was, say, going down on her, and she felt so aroused that she thought she might have an orgasm, she\u2019d remember that she wasn\u2019t supposed to have an orgasm, and then the little monitor would keep checking her arousal level and comparing it with her goal state of not having an orgasm, which means her monitor would keep thinking about orgasm and how close she was to it. \u2003Embedded in the thought \u201cDon\u2019t have an orgasm\u201d is \u201c\u2026 have an orgasm.\u201d\u201d And if I say to you, \u201cDon\u2019t think about a bear,\u201d what\u2019s the first thing that happens? \u2003Orgasms aren\u2019t as automatic as thoughts, but in the right, sex-positive context, if you make orgasm against the rules and then give the person a lot of time to try not to have an orgasm\u2026 I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s a fun game and you might want to try it sometime. \u2003Which brings me to the orgasm your partner can\u2019t stop themselves from having. \u2003Henry is just about as smart as Camilla. I know this because one day she called me and said that he had stuck to their agreement better than she had\u2014he was using a vibrator on her and she had been close and actually wanted to have an orgasm, but he stopped before she got there. \u2003She was frustrated. And even a little pissed. But hey, the rule was her idea. He was being a gentleman. \u2003He did this two more times\u2014got her close, then backed off. \u2003Because he is such a gentleman. \u2003And eventually he got her so close that she genuinely couldn\u2019t stop herself from having an orgasm. Which is a neat trick\u2014women don\u2019t have a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d for orgasm the way men do for ejaculation. To get a woman to be unable to stop herself from coming takes a high level of persistent arousal. \u2003And yes, again, being a sex educator is the best job in the world when people tell you stories like this.","title":"Chasing dynamic"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/True_Stories/#pleasure","text":"Some one said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to feel good when so much of the world is such a mess\u201d.

Life is complicated and Laurie still has times when she gets sucked into exhaustion and overwhelm, times when her body seems to shut out all potential sources of pleasure. But three things changed permanently. \u2003First, she practiced paying nonjudgmental attention to sensations, which taught her to be as kind and generous with herself as she was with everyone else she loved. She learned to notice and celebrate pleasure and joy, granting herself permission to feel good. \u2003Second, though there wasn\u2019t much she could do to reduce the actualstressors in her life, she reduced her stress by taking more deliberate effort to decompress and complete the stress response cycles that life activated. She let herself cry. She slowed down her showers, paid attention to the sensation of the water on her skin, and instead of slapping on body lotion like she was greasing a loaf pan, she paid attention to how nice it felt and how healthy her skin was. As she exercised, she visualized her stress as that orange monster in the Bugs Bunny cartoon\u2014the one Bugs gives a manicure\u2014and imagines herself running away from the monster, through her front door, and into Johnny\u2019s arms. She started experiencing the discharge of stress as pleasurable\u2014or at least not a source of suffering. \u2003And finally, she became much gentler with herself when she noticed herself being self-critical about her body or feeling guilty about pleasure. She didn\u2019t say to herself, \u201cStop it!\u201d She just thought, \u201cYup. There are the self- critical thoughts again.\u201d She practiced nonjudgment. Habits : Non-judge .
