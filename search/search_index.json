First is confidence , then joy . Confidence is not enough, and joy is the hard part. Glossary # This chapter # Confidence : Knowing what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. Knowing that your genitals are made of the same parts as everyone else\u2019s, organized in a unique way. Knowing about the brakes and accelerator. Knowing about context and about the difference between liking, wanting, and learning. Knowing about arousal non-concordance and responsive desire. Knowing what\u2019s really true, even when it\u2019s not what you were taught \u201cshould\u201d be true. Knowing what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you wish were true. Joy : Loving what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. Loving your genitals, your brakes and accelerator, and the way your brain responds to context. Loving the context itself. Loving arousal non-concordance and responsive desire. Loving what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you were taught \u201cshould\u201d be true. Loving what\u2019s true, even when it\u2019s not what you wish were true. Non-judge : Not categorizing your internal experience as good or bad, right or wrong. In other words, non-judging allows you to feel what you feel, whether or not it makes sense to you, whether or not it\u2019s comfortable, whether or not it\u2019s what you believe you should be feeling. Non-judging is neutrally noticing your own internal states. With non-judging, it doesn\u2019t matter how you feel; what matters is how you feel about how you feel. And the most wellness-promoting way to feel is\u2026 neutral. Script : Something that should be that way. The social messages are scripts . Map (Model) : An abstract representation of something that exists in reality. The social messages are maps . Other chapters # Normal and broken Social messages: Moral, media and medical messages Negative feelings Little monitor : Everyone have a little monitor in their minds that checks constantly for a gap between theirs expectations of their goals and theirs experiences. If your expectations are not being met your notice the gap . If your experiences are over your expectations you feel good and motivated; but if your experiences are under your expectations you get frustrated, stressed and disappointed, so you do it even worse, thus increasing the gap , falling into a vicious circle. Stress # Stress response : Psychological, physiological and behavioral stress response . Stress response happens in the mind as well as in the body . Psychological stress response : When the stressor high and short then the main response is full focus on the stressor and fear. When the stressor is low and constantly the main response is anxiety and trouble focusing, because you are concerned about the stressor . Physiological stress response : Increase heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, muscles tighten, blood flows to the skin, pupils dilate, the immune, digestive and reproductive systems stop, and all you can think about is the problem. Behavioral stress response : Freeze, fight or flee. When the stressor is low and constantly these responses are often manifested as anxiety behaviors like insomnia (fight or flee mentally, focus on the stressor ), argue more frequently (fight), compulsive behaviors (i.e. over-eating) (trying to de-stress ), nervous (i.e. change posture) (flee), etc. Stressor : Context that activate the stress response . The stressors have an intensity and a duration, i.e. a lion is a super strong stressor but short, while bills are low stressors but constantly. Some typical stressors are bills, family, work, fretting about your sex life, etc. De-stressor : Context that communicate to your body, \u201cYou have escaped and survived!\u201d Physical activity Sharing affection Primal scream or a good cry Progressive muscle relaxation or other sensorimotor meditation Body self-care, like grooming, massage, or doing your nails De-stress : Communicate to your body \u201cI\u2019m safe, I\u2019ve escaped and survived\u201d through de-stressors . So you stop the stress response . Stress cycle : A stressor (or many) activate your stress response , you experience the stress response until you In nature the stress situations hit the stressors with high intensity but short, so the stressor is over quickly and is easy to de-stress . But nowadays the stress contexts hit with low intensity but constantly, and it is also socially frowned upon to express your feelings, so we can\u2019t de-stress properly. That is why stress nowadays is a major problem for most people. Confidence: The map # Step 1: Analyze your sexuality # Ask yourself: What are my accelerators and brakes and how sensitives are they? What are my stressors and how sensitive they are? Which is my desire type? Do I have spontaneous, responsive or context-dependent desire? Does my genital response predict my arousal? How much? How do I reach orgasm? Do I need clitoral stimulation? Tell yourself that whatever your answer is, you are normal. Your body is also normal. If you have a partner ask yourself what you think their responses would be. Then ask him/her to answer the questions. Let him/her know what your answers were. Step 2: Notice the gap # Your feelings are always true, so notice them. If you have negative feelings experiencing your sexuality probably it\u2019s your little monitor fault, noticing that the expectations you have for your goals are not being met. So close the gap by reality-check . This also applies to what you feel about your partner sexuality, i.e. you feel your partner should have \u201cmore\u201d\u2014Maybe you have spontaneous desire and you think your partner responsive desire as lesser (it\u2019s an opinion not a fact)\u2014sexual desire. Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual scripts . These scripts provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these scripts act as barriers between us and joy. Map and terrain metaphor # What would you say if a map doesn\u2019t match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes? Which is wrong, the map or the terrain? Everyone would probably say that it is the terrain that is wrong. But what if everyone says the map is right and it\u2019s the terrain you\u2019re looking at which\u2019s wrong? Our sexual scripts are our the map , and our experiences are our terrain. When our experiences don\u2019t match the map our brains try to make the map true, forcing our experience into the shape of the map . You feel your experiences should match the map , i.e. a gap. That is why the little monitor activates. The first step toward joy is to recognize a mismatch between the map and the terrain, with the knowledge that the terrain is always right. Once you recognize this mismatch, you have to draw a new map grounded on science and your own experience. Why confidence is not enough? # Because maybe you already know what is true about yourself (and about your partner) but you don\u2019t accept it. So you hit your brakes . Scripts aren\u2019t about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it. There are some ways that may make you struggle to reach joy : To think of yourself as lesser. A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that \u2018responsive desire\u2019 is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire. Most women have \u201ca lesser desire?\u201d Yeowch. The construction of responsive desire as \u201clesser\u201d is not a \u201cfact,\u201d of course; it\u2019s a value judgment, an opinion. Solution : Notice that it\u2019s an opinion not a fact. Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are broken . The worst case is when these people are people you love. Solution : Trust you and science, not social messages . To have negative feelings about what is true of yourself, for being as you are. Solution : Don\u2019t lock up those feelings, address them by non-judging . Complete the stress cycle . Link your personality to one of those social messages . Smart women don\u2019t want sex. Smart girls are interested in minds, not bodies; only stupid girls are ruled by their \u201cbase animal instincts.\u201d Solution : Notice you are just playing a role. People are always playing roles (as partner, parent, child, uncle, student, employee, boss, etc.\u2014You even behave differently with different groups of friends). But you are not the role you are playing, you are not even the role you play being alone. Everyone is free; so you don\u2019t have to play a role you have been playing. You probably didn\u2019t consciously chosen that role and it\u2019s just an absurd social message . Joy : The hard part # You sense, that sensations generate a feeling, then you judge that feeling based on your beliefs and expectations\u2014that\u2019s your little monitor . Step 3: How you feel about how you feel? # Once you have confidence and you had drawn a new map , how do you feel about what your map (your sexuality) is like? You may have negative feelings about it. Negative feelings hurts, so people usually lock them deep inside themselves, without completing the stress cycle and not healing themselves. Whenever you notice a negative feeling ask yourself (don\u2019t lock it): How I feel? Which negative feeling it is? What is making me feel this way? What are my thoughts about it? Am I judging it? On what belief or expectation do I base my judgment? It is this belief true? Do reality-check and heal that feeling by completing the stress cycle . Step 4: How to non-judge ? # The definition is above . What is the non-judging for? Non-judging can help in: Feelings that happen for \u201cno good reason\u201d. Healing trauma. Resolving pain. Increasing pleasure. Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d. Non-judging is so good because helps to completing the stress cycle . I used to think that it was the awareness of your internal state that mattered, but in study after study, \u201cobservation\u201d of internal state is not a significant predictor of wellbeing. Instead, the most important variable is \u201cnon-judging\u201d. Non-judge # Feelings that happen for \u201cno good reason\u201d # You have stress about something you can\u2019t do anything about\u2014A bad new you see on TV, your favorite character of the book you are reading dies, something that reminds you of something bad from the past, etc.\u2014so you can\u2019t complete the stress cycle easily fleeing or fighting, because you are not there. Let you feel your feeling by non-judging and tell yourself \u201cIt\u2019s ok, I can\u2019t do anything about it, so don\u2019t make sense to feel that way\u201d . When we have feelings we can\u2019t really do anything about, and we don\u2019t know how to let ourselves simply feel without doing anything, our brains will look for some situation it can do something about, and it will try to impose the feelings on that situation. I.e. You feel angry with the result of the football match so you yell at your son at the slightest thing you can scold him about. Healing a trauma # A trauma is a wound in your mind. And like a wound in the body, it causes pain, but emotional pain, not physical pain. The pain is part of the healing process. But if you numb your physical pain, healing can still happen. Alas, if we try to \u201cnumb\u201d your emotional pain, we get a break from the pain\u2026 but the healing is put on pause. For healing a trauma you have to let yourself feel what you feel without lock those feelings. This usually implies suffering and patience, maybe months. Someone described this process like: \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 I\u2019m sitting with a stunned bird in the palm of my hand. If I get tense and try to hurry it, it will just stay frozen. But if I\u2019m still and patient long enough, the bird will wake up and fly away.\u201d Resolving pain # First you need to know: Pain is not normal. \u00a1Never! All pain is created in the brain, in response to the body\u2019s signals that there is some kind of threat. Pain is a signal that your brain perceives a threat, and you might need help. If you use your own internal experience, rather than culturally imposed criterion velocities, as your most accurate source of knowledge about sex, you\u2019ll be able to hear your brain\u2019s signal that you need help, and you\u2019ll take it seriously. Many people don\u2019t take pain seriously, and this is mainly due to social messages like: Pain in sex is normal. Pain in sex is pleasure. Pain is part of the life. Don\u2019t complain, get over it. Mentally strong people do not complain. Have a glass of wine and relax. Ladies like a bit of pain. Girls like rough sex. Girls are sexy when they scream. If there is no infection or injury, the pain is \u201call in her head.\u201d ( medical message ) Any unwanted pain is not normal. Our willingness to tolerate greater effort\u2014in this case, pain\u2014is learned. And it can be changed, simply by becoming aware of it and allowing the possibility that it could be different. Be aware that you feel pain and tell yourself \u201cPain is not normal. I don\u2019t have to deal with pain. There are solutions. I will seek for a solution\u201d. This is as literal as it gets: It\u2019s not how you feel (pain). It\u2019s how you feel (tolerant or not) about how you feel. Non-judging doesn\u2019t mean resignation. It means turning toward what\u2019s true with kindness, without self-criticism. With non-judging, you can ask for help. See pain causes . Increasing pleasure # Pleasure is the hardest part, because there are many social messages about it, and they are laden with \u201cshoulds\u201d and negative feelings . Many of us have been taught that pleasure is selfish, sinful, a waste of time, or something to be ashamed of. How dare we attend to what feels good, when we ought to be attending to other people\u2019s needs or our partner or making sure we meet other people\u2019s expectations? Too many people make their choices based not on what they like, but on what they believe their partner likes or what they\u2019ve been told they \u201cshould\u201d like. So how can I allow myself to enjoy the pleasure? Practice non-judging when you feel pleasure and tell yourself: Pleasure is normal. Feel pleasure is ok. My pleasure come first, then others. I don\u2019t have to act as social messages says. Someone said: \u201cI can\u2019t be a source of joy in the lives of the people I love if I can\u2019t even be a source of joy for myself.\u201d By not judging, you allow yourself to experience pleasure and enhance it, leading you straight to ecstasy. This is a strange truth about non-judgment. When you turn toward suffering with non-judgment, the suffering diminishes as wounds heal. When you turn toward pleasure with non-judgment, it expands to all the space judgment once filled. That happens because you brain has a processing capacity. If you spend part of it judging, you can\u2019t devote all your capacity to healing or pleasure. But here is the truth: Pleasure is a gateway to accessing your fullest, truest personhood. Pleasure is where you find a no-holds-barred connection with yourself and with those you love most. Why? Because pleasure only happens in a context where your brain feels safe enough to be completely and entirely you, without shame or social performance or \u201cshoulds.\u201d Ecstasy comes to us when we leave behind everything that doesn\u2019t delight us or spark our curiosity. Ecstasy comes when we surrender to pleasure without reservation. You are allowed to like pleasure. Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d # For some people knowing what is true (confidence) is enough to set them free from the myths of social messages . Others also need to notice their judgmental feelings, so they can release those social messages by non-judging . But for others (the worst case) notice their judgmental feelings is not enough to free themselves from those social messages . Why? Many of our goals (the \u201cshoulds\u201d) in lives, have been imposed on us through the social messages \u2014especially in sexuality because it is so taboo\u2014, so release those myths from social messages is to say to your little monitor \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry but I give up, it\u2019s impossible\u201d . And you already know how your little monitor reacts to this, with awful feelings (the worst of the negative feelings ), it\u2019s the ultimate disappointment for the little monitor , you feel like a complete failure. You have given up what you were taught was the right map . Many of these social messages are so deep in our minds that we had built our personalities based on them. That\u2019s why reach joy becomes so difficult for many people, because free themselves from those social messages implies a failure and leave behind part of his personality. You are pulling up all the weeds (poisonous goals and beliefs) from your mental garden (your mind), which happened to be most of the plants, leaving it almost deserted. It hurts so much. The way to get through is to stay very still, to notice all the aspects of your identity that were tied to the lies you were told, to notice all the grief you feel in letting go of the self you spent your life trying to be. Notice, too, the anger you feel at having been lied to for so long. Notice all of these with non-judgment. Allow them to be true. Emotions are tunnels: You have to go through the darkness to get to the light at the end. Sometimes that\u2019s fairly easy, but sometimes it hurts like hell. Sometimes letting go of a particular goal feels like you have to let go of your entire identity. It\u2019s not an easy process; parts of it are downright uncomfortable. But it\u2019s so, so worth it, because at the end of the tunnel is the ultimate reward: you. To feel normal # You belongs # What do you think your goal is? Is it pleasure? Connection with her partner? Self-discovery? For most people the main goal is to feel \u201c normal \u201d (the social meaning). But there is no such a thing like \u201c normal \u201d, because we all are normal (the real meaning). What people really aim by being \u201c normal \u201d is to feel that they belong , we are social beings. If you feel that you don\u2019t belong you feel lost, what implies risk and insecurity. We want to know that we are safe within the bounds of shared human experience, that what\u2019s on our map is the same as what is on other people\u2019s maps. When people ask me, \u201cAm I normal?\u201d they\u2019re asking, \u201cDo I belong?\u201d \u2003The answer is yes. You belong in your body. You belong in the world. You\u2019ve belonged since the day you were born, this is your home. You don\u2019t have to earn it by conforming to some externally imposed sexual standard. \u2003If you change your goal from \u201cnormal\u201d to \u201cwherever I belong,\u201d then you\u2019re always successful because you\u2019re already there. This is it # You are as you are now, this is it. For many years, I kept a small comic taped to my office door. It shows an old Buddhist monk sitting next to a young Buddhist monk. The older monk is saying, \u201cNothing happens next. This is it.\u201d \u2003Being more nerd than nun, I see it as a commentary on the discrepancy-reducing feedback loop and criterion velocity, on the importance of training your little monitor to enjoy the present rather than constantly push toward the future. What if\u2026 this is a radical idea, but just go with me: What if you felt that way\u2014\u201cThis is it\u201d\u2014about your sexual functioning? What if the sexuality you have right now is the sexuality you get? What if this is it? If you have negative feeling noticing that \u201cthis is it\u201d, you are feeling the gap between your goal of \u201c normal \u201d (social meaning) and how you are. But remember that you are already normal (the real meaning). See Mourning the \u201cshoulds\u201d Not your fault but your responsibility # Culture has planted weeds in our mental garden with social messages from a young age, shaping what we believe to be \u201cnormal\u201d (social meaning). So it is our job to pull out the weeds. Even though it is not our fault, is your responsibility. You are already normal (real meaning). The day you were born, the world had a choice about what to teach you about your body. It could have taught you to live with confidence and joy inside your body. It could have taught you that your body and your sexuality are beautiful gifts. But instead, the world taught you to feel critical of and dissatisfied with your sexuality and your body. You were taught to value and expect something from your sexuality that does not match what your sexuality actually is. You were told a story about what would happen in your sexual life, and that story was false. You were lied to.","title":"Chapter 9: Love what is true"},{"location":"come_as_you_are_emily_nagoski/chapter_9_love_what_is_true/#chapter-9-love-what-is-true","text":"This chapter is about how to reach the ecstasy through confidence and joy in whole you.

Once you recognize this mismatch, you have to draw a new map grounded on science and your own experience.","title":"Map and terrain metaphor"},{"location":"come_as_you_are_emily_nagoski/chapter_9_love_what_is_true/#why-confidence-is-not-enough","text":"Because maybe you already know what is true about yourself (and about your partner) but you don\u2019t accept it. So you hit your brakes . Scripts aren\u2019t about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it. There are some ways that may make you struggle to reach joy : To think of yourself as lesser. A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that \u2018responsive desire\u2019 is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire. Most women have \u201ca lesser desire?\u201d Yeowch. The construction of responsive desire as \u201clesser\u201d is not a \u201cfact,\u201d of course; it\u2019s a value judgment, an opinion. Solution : Notice that it\u2019s an opinion not a fact. Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are broken . The worst case is when these people are people you love. Solution : Trust you and science, not social messages . To have negative feelings about what is true of yourself, for being as you are. Solution : Don\u2019t lock up those feelings, address them by non-judging . Complete the stress cycle . Link your personality to one of those social messages . Smart women don\u2019t want sex. Smart girls are interested in minds, not bodies; only stupid girls are ruled by their \u201cbase animal instincts.\u201d Solution : Notice you are just playing a role. People are always playing roles (as partner, parent, child, uncle, student, employee, boss, etc.\u2014You even behave differently with different groups of friends). But you are not the role you are playing, you are not even the role you play being alone. Everyone is free; so you don\u2019t have to play a role you have been playing.

Many of us have been taught that pleasure is selfish, sinful, a waste of time, or something to be ashamed of. How dare we attend to what feels good, when we ought to be attending to other people\u2019s needs or our partner or making sure we meet other people\u2019s expectations? Too many people make their choices based not on what they like, but on what they believe their partner likes or what they\u2019ve been told they \u201cshould\u201d like. So how can I allow myself to enjoy the pleasure? Practice non-judging when you feel pleasure and tell yourself: Pleasure is normal. Feel pleasure is ok. My pleasure come first, then others. I don\u2019t have to act as social messages says. Someone said: \u201cI can\u2019t be a source of joy in the lives of the people I love if I can\u2019t even be a source of joy for myself.\u201d By not judging, you allow yourself to experience pleasure and enhance it, leading you straight to ecstasy. This is a strange truth about non-judgment. When you turn toward suffering with non-judgment, the suffering diminishes as wounds heal. When you turn toward pleasure with non-judgment, it expands to all the space judgment once filled. That happens because you brain has a processing capacity. If you spend part of it judging, you can\u2019t devote all your capacity to healing or pleasure. But here is the truth: Pleasure is a gateway to accessing your fullest, truest personhood. Pleasure is where you find a no-holds-barred connection with yourself and with those you love most. Why? Because pleasure only happens in a context where your brain feels safe enough to be completely and entirely you, without shame or social performance or \u201cshoulds.\u201d Ecstasy comes to us when we leave behind everything that doesn\u2019t delight us or spark our curiosity.

Many of our goals (the \u201cshoulds\u201d) in lives, have been imposed on us through the social messages \u2014especially in sexuality because it is so taboo\u2014, so release those myths from social messages is to say to your little monitor \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry but I give up, it\u2019s impossible\u201d .

The way to get through is to stay very still, to notice all the aspects of your identity that were tied to the lies you were told, to notice all the grief you feel in letting go of the self you spent your life trying to be. Notice, too, the anger you feel at having been lied to for so long. Notice all of these with non-judgment. Allow them to be true. Emotions are tunnels: You have to go through the darkness to get to the light at the end. Sometimes that\u2019s fairly easy, but sometimes it hurts like hell. Sometimes letting go of a particular goal feels like you have to let go of your entire identity. It\u2019s not an easy process; parts of it are downright uncomfortable.

Medically. With medication. Or possibly surgery. To the extent that a woman\u2019s sexual response differs from a man\u2019s, she is diseased\u2014except for pregnancy, which is what sex is for. Normal and broken # Note : When \u201cnormal\u201d is written without italics it\u2019s because it is not referring to a concrete meaning, but to the ambiguous meaning that people have in their heads\u2014e.g. when people ask \u201cAm I normal?\u201d, but if you ask them \u201cWhat is normal?\u201d they are not clear about it. Normal (social meaning) : You are like social messages says you should be. Which is totally impossible because many social messages are opposites. Normal (most frequent) : You are from the most frequent group\u2014e.g., the most frequent sexual orientation is heterosexual and you are heterosexual. Notice that the most frequent group is not what social messages says\u2014e.g., the most frequent way for women to reach orgasm is through clitoral stimulation, but social messages say that penetration is the way to reach orgasm.

Usual : One of the types in the diversity, regardless of whether it is the most frequent, none better than the other\u2014e.g. all eye colors are usual and equally valid.

Typical questions # Some typical questions this book answers: Once my partner initiates, I\u2019m into it, but it seems like it never even occurs to me to be the one to start things. Why is that? Answer : You have responsive-desire. What is usual . My boyfriend was like, \u201cYou\u2019re not ready, you\u2019re still dry.\u201d But I was so ready. So why wasn\u2019t I wet? Answer : You experience non-concordance. What is usual . I saw this thing about women who can\u2019t enjoy sex because they worry about their bodies the whole time. That\u2019s me. How do I stop doing that? Answer : By non-judging. It\u2019s a usual problem. I read something about women who stop wanting sex after a while in a relationship, even if they still love their partner. That\u2019s me. How do I start wanting sex with my partner again? Answer Maybe chasing dynamic (set a rule against sex temporally), stressed (complete the cycle) or context (create a sex-positive context). I think maybe I peed when I had an orgasm\u2026? Answer : It\u2019s a squirt, vaginal fluids, not pee. It\u2019s usual to feel like you were to pee at orgasm, enjoy it, don\u2019t hit you brakes. I think maybe I\u2019ve never had an orgasm\u2026? Answer : If you doubt, probably don\u2019t. Do you know where is you clit? Take a mirror and look at it, pay attention to it the next time you masturbate or have sex. Clit stimulation is the most usual way to reach orgasm for women. Make your partner know it. Fact : Less than a quarter of woman are reliably orgasmic by intercourse. People have so many questions, the most of them hide behind the question \u201cam I normal?\u201d What is normal? # See normal and broken meanings. People\u2019s most important concern is \u201cAm I normal?\u201d. Why feel normal is so important? # Because we are social beings, so not being normal involves danger. See to feel normal . People are different # Each person is different from each other, even twins. We\u2019re all made of the same parts, but in each of us, those parts are organized in a unique way that may change over our life span. people are so different from each other that there is often more difference between two people of the same gender than between the averages of the genders. People are normal (positive meaning) # Is mandatory to see normal and broken meanings. Same parts # But being different doesn\u2019t imply being broken . Indeed, \u201cwe\u2019re all made of the same parts\u201d. Women and men both experience orgasm, desire, and arousal, and men, too, can experience responsive desire, arousal nonconcordance, and lack of orgasm with penetration. Women and men both can fall in love, fantasize, masturbate, feel puzzled about sex, and experience ecstatic pleasure. They both can ooze fluids, travel forbidden paths of sexual imagination, encounter the unexpected and startling ways that sex shows up in every domain of life\u2014and confront the unexpected and startling ways that sex sometimes declines, politely or otherwise, to show up. Differences are usual # Even the differences in these parts are usual . No organization is better or worse than any other, and no phase in our life span is better or worse than any other; they\u2019re just different. An apple tree can be healthy no matter what variety of apple it is\u2014though one variety may need constant direct sunlight and another might enjoy some shade. And an apple tree can be healthy when it\u2019s a seed, when it\u2019s a seedling, as it\u2019s growing, and as it fades at the end of the season, as well as when, in late summer, it is laden with fruit. But it has different needs at each of those phases in its life. So, what is the problem? # The problem is that people are not aware of the different meanings of \u201cnormal\u201d; so when they ask \u201cAm I normal\u201d the culture imposes its social meaning \u201cNo, you are not normal (social meaning) because you [any social message here]\u201d. So, what is the solution? # The solution is to first realize that when society tells you\u2014not literally, but when you realize that you are criticizing yourself or you have negative feelings about yourself\u2014through social messages \u201cyou are not normal (social meaning)\u201d what they are really saying is \u201cyou don\u2019t fit all my impossible myths, so you are broken \u201d and then tell yourself \u201cthat\u2019s not true, I\u2019m completely normal \u201d. It seems very simple, doesn\u2019t it? Indeed, is not that simple. You have grown up with these social messages , so it takes time and courage to change those self-destructive thoughts in your head. But don\u2019t give up, it\u2019s worth it, you can do it, little by little you will feel that you are getting better and better. See Chapter 9: Love what is true for more. History of sexuality # The history of sexuality is still very influential today\u2014as the new science is still very new and sexuality is still very taboo. But don\u2019t worry this book is about new science. How ? and Why ? # Historically researches about sexuality was based on the behaviour\u2014the \u201chow?\u201d . But to really understand sexuality it is also necessary to know the psychology behind this behavior\u2014the \u201cwhy?\u201d . Trying to understand sex by looking at behavior is like trying to understand love by looking at a couple\u2019s wedding portrait\u2026 and their divorce papers. [\u2026] Without better evidence, we\u2019re mostly guessing. Women as men # Historically women\u2019s sexuality has remained in the shadows of men\u2019s sexuality. Men reach orgasm by penetration and have spontaneous desire\u2014most of them, not all. But science was very dogmatic back then\u2014so women should too. Are you a woman who does not reach orgasm by penetration or do you have no spontaneous desire? You are deceased. Science nowadays # Good news. Nowadays, science about sexuality is also asking about the \u201cwhy\u201d? and acknowledges the importance of women\u2019s sexuality. How this book will change your life # The information in this book will show you that whatever you\u2019re experiencing in your sexuality\u2014whether it\u2019s challenges with arousal, desire, orgasm, pain, no sexual sensations, whatever\u2014is the result of your sexual response mechanism functioning appropriately\u2026 in an inappropriate world. You are normal; it is the world around you that\u2019s broken. \u2003That\u2019s actually the bad news. \u2003The good news is that when you understand how your sexual response mechanism works, you can begin to take control of your environment and your brain in order to maximize your sexual potential, even in a broken world. And when you change your environment and your brain, you can change\u2014and heal\u2014your sexual functioning.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"come_as_you_are_emily_nagoski/introduction_yes_you_are_normal/#introduction-yes-you-are-normal","text":"","title":"Introduction: Yes, you are normal"},{"location":"come_as_you_are_emily_nagoski/introduction_yes_you_are_normal/#glossary","text":"Negative feelings : Feelings like hate, angry, frustration, despair, disappointment and shame.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"come_as_you_are_emily_nagoski/introduction_yes_you_are_normal/#social-messages","text":"Includes moral, media and medical messages.

Answer : You experience non-concordance. What is usual . I saw this thing about women who can\u2019t enjoy sex because they worry about their bodies the whole time. That\u2019s me. How do I stop doing that? Answer : By non-judging. It\u2019s a usual problem. I read something about women who stop wanting sex after a while in a relationship, even if they still love their partner. That\u2019s me. How do I start wanting sex with my partner again? Answer Maybe chasing dynamic (set a rule against sex temporally), stressed (complete the cycle) or context (create a sex-positive context). I think maybe I peed when I had an orgasm\u2026? Answer : It\u2019s a squirt, vaginal fluids, not pee. It\u2019s usual to feel like you were to pee at orgasm, enjoy it, don\u2019t hit you brakes. I think maybe I\u2019ve never had an orgasm\u2026? Answer : If you doubt, probably don\u2019t. Do you know where is you clit? Take a mirror and look at it, pay attention to it the next time you masturbate or have sex. Clit stimulation is the most usual way to reach orgasm for women. Make your partner know it. Fact : Less than a quarter of woman are reliably orgasmic by intercourse.

These women don\u2019t exist as individuals; they\u2019re composites, integrating the real stories of the many women I\u2019ve taught, talked with, emailed, and supported in my two decades as a sex educator. You can imagine each woman as a collage of snapshots\u2014the face from one photograph, the arms from another, the feet from a third\u2026 each part represents someone real, and the collection hangs together meaningfully, but I\u2019ve invented the relationships that the parts have to each other. Reality check # Is this the rigth goal for me? # In chapter 5, when Laurie decided to stop trying to want sex with Johnny and just allowed herself not to, she closed the gap between where she was and where she wanted to be, which opened the door to affection without performance demand. She allowed herself to be a woman who doesn\u2019t want sex to release the pressure she was under. This way she was capable of enjoying sex without pressure. Am Im putting in the right amount of the rigth kind of effort? # In chapter 8, when Olivia meditated her way to an extended orgasm, she was practicing being present as she was, rather than pushing forward to some goal. She kept the same goal\u2014ecstasy\u2014but she changed the kind of effort she was investing. From quick sex to reach orgasm to slow sex for enjoyment and ecstasy, achieving longer-lasting and better orgasms. And in chapter 7, when Merritt, instead of trying on the aspirational identity of a woman who loves sex, embraced the identity of a woman who did not want sex, she was changing the kind of effort she invested, to attain her goal of trusting herself. The result was not sinking down forever into a state of not wanting sex\u2014on the contrary! Allowing herself to be where she was opened the door to where she wanted to go. From striving to want to be a woman who likes sex to striving to trust herself. Are my expectations of how much effort this particular goal requires realistic? # Since Ms. B. entered her mid-40s, she says, sex has been more about smoke and mirrors than thunder and lightning. She is rarely if ever interested enough to initiate it with her partner of 10 years, and she does not reach climax during the act. She wishes it were otherwise. Having gotten this far in the book, you\u2019ll recognize that Ms. B.\u2019s desire style may be responsive rather than spontaneous, and it sounds like she\u2019s not reliably orgasmic with intercourse. Both of these put her squarely in the majority. The expectations she had about how much effort it takes to reach orgasm by intercourse without clitoral stimulation was unrealistic. Chasing dynamic # What says, \u201cYou are awesome in bed!\u201d more clearly than your partner\u2019s orgasm? \u2003Your partner not being able to stop themselves from having an orgasm\u2014especially if that partner has a slightly stubborn accelerator. \u2003Camilla thought through the \u201cIf I make you a pizza and you only eat one slice, how does that make me feel?\u201d problem logically and came to a smart conclusion: \u2003They made a rule against her having orgasm. \u2003They could do anything else they wanted, but Camilla wasn\u2019t allowed to have any orgasms. It\u2019s a reverse psychology trick that you\u2019d never expect to work in real life\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have an orgasm? Fine. You\u2019re not allowed to have an orgasm!\u201d\u2014but it actually does. \u2003| The rule did two things. First, it genuinely took away performance pressure from Camilla and frustrated expectations from Henry. They could both relax and forget about it, which made them both feel better. \u2003It had another impact, too. Henry had already shifted the way he thought about foreplay and was thinking of their entire relationship as an opportunity to tease Camilla\u2019s ticking pilot light. The new rule took that to \u2003another level. \u2003See, taking orgasm off the table put Camilla\u2019s little monitor in a puzzling situation. If Henry was, say, going down on her, and she felt so aroused that she thought she might have an orgasm, she\u2019d remember that she wasn\u2019t supposed to have an orgasm, and then the little monitor would keep checking her arousal level and comparing it with her goal state of not having an orgasm, which means her monitor would keep thinking about orgasm and how close she was to it. \u2003Embedded in the thought \u201cDon\u2019t have an orgasm\u201d is \u201c\u2026 have an orgasm.\u201d\u201d And if I say to you, \u201cDon\u2019t think about a bear,\u201d what\u2019s the first thing that happens? \u2003Orgasms aren\u2019t as automatic as thoughts, but in the right, sex-positive context, if you make orgasm against the rules and then give the person a lot of time to try not to have an orgasm\u2026 I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s a fun game and you might want to try it sometime. \u2003Which brings me to the orgasm your partner can\u2019t stop themselves from having. \u2003Henry is just about as smart as Camilla. I know this because one day she called me and said that he had stuck to their agreement better than she had\u2014he was using a vibrator on her and she had been close and actually wanted to have an orgasm, but he stopped before she got there. \u2003She was frustrated. And even a little pissed. But hey, the rule was her idea. He was being a gentleman. \u2003He did this two more times\u2014got her close, then backed off. \u2003Because he is such a gentleman. \u2003And eventually he got her so close that she genuinely couldn\u2019t stop herself from having an orgasm. Which is a neat trick\u2014women don\u2019t have a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d for orgasm the way men do for ejaculation. To get a woman to be unable to stop herself from coming takes a high level of persistent arousal. \u2003And yes, again, being a sex educator is the best job in the world when people tell you stories like this. Pleasure # Some one said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to feel good when so much of the world is such a mess\u201d. Solution : Pleasure is not a sin. Habits # Laurie and Johnny lived happily ever after\u2014or most of the time ever after. Life is complicated and Laurie still has times when she gets sucked into exhaustion and overwhelm, times when her body seems to shut out all potential sources of pleasure. But three things changed permanently. \u2003First, she practiced paying nonjudgmental attention to sensations, which taught her to be as kind and generous with herself as she was with everyone else she loved. She learned to notice and celebrate pleasure and joy, granting herself permission to feel good. \u2003Second, though there wasn\u2019t much she could do to reduce the actualstressors in her life, she reduced her stress by taking more deliberate effort to decompress and complete the stress response cycles that life activated. She let herself cry. She slowed down her showers, paid attention to the sensation of the water on her skin, and instead of slapping on body lotion like she was greasing a loaf pan, she paid attention to how nice it felt and how healthy her skin was. As she exercised, she visualized her stress as that orange monster in the Bugs Bunny cartoon\u2014the one Bugs gives a manicure\u2014and imagines herself running away from the monster, through her front door, and into Johnny\u2019s arms. She started experiencing the discharge of stress as pleasurable\u2014or at least not a source of suffering. \u2003And finally, she became much gentler with herself when she noticed herself being self-critical about her body or feeling guilty about pleasure. She didn\u2019t say to herself, \u201cStop it!\u201d She just thought, \u201cYup. There are the self- critical thoughts again.\u201d She practiced nonjudgment. Habits : Non-judge .

I know this because one day she called me and said that he had stuck to their agreement better than she had\u2014he was using a vibrator on her and she had been close and actually wanted to have an orgasm, but he stopped before she got there. \u2003She was frustrated. And even a little pissed. But hey, the rule was her idea. He was being a gentleman. \u2003He did this two more times\u2014got her close, then backed off. \u2003Because he is such a gentleman. \u2003And eventually he got her so close that she genuinely couldn\u2019t stop herself from having an orgasm. Which is a neat trick\u2014women don\u2019t have a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d for orgasm the way men do for ejaculation. To get a woman to be unable to stop herself from coming takes a high level of persistent arousal. \u2003And yes, again, being a sex educator is the best job in the world when people tell you stories like this.","title":"Chasing dynamic"},{"location":"come_as_you_are_emily_nagoski/stories/#pleasure","text":"Some one said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to feel good when so much of the world is such a mess\u201d.

Life is complicated and Laurie still has times when she gets sucked into exhaustion and overwhelm, times when her body seems to shut out all potential sources of pleasure. But three things changed permanently. \u2003First, she practiced paying nonjudgmental attention to sensations, which taught her to be as kind and generous with herself as she was with everyone else she loved. She learned to notice and celebrate pleasure and joy, granting herself permission to feel good. \u2003Second, though there wasn\u2019t much she could do to reduce the actualstressors in her life, she reduced her stress by taking more deliberate effort to decompress and complete the stress response cycles that life activated. She let herself cry. She slowed down her showers, paid attention to the sensation of the water on her skin, and instead of slapping on body lotion like she was greasing a loaf pan, she paid attention to how nice it felt and how healthy her skin was. As she exercised, she visualized her stress as that orange monster in the Bugs Bunny cartoon\u2014the one Bugs gives a manicure\u2014and imagines herself running away from the monster, through her front door, and into Johnny\u2019s arms. She started experiencing the discharge of stress as pleasurable\u2014or at least not a source of suffering. \u2003And finally, she became much gentler with herself when she noticed herself being self-critical about her body or feeling guilty about pleasure. She didn\u2019t say to herself, \u201cStop it!\u201d She just thought, \u201cYup. There are the self- critical thoughts again.\u201d She practiced nonjudgment. Habits : Non-judge .
