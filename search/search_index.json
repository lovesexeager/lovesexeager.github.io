Map (Model) : An abstract representation of something that exists in reality. Our sexual scripts are maps . Observe : Notice you internal experience. Non-judge : Not categorizing your internal experience as good or bad, right or wrong. In other words, non-judging allows you to feel what you feel, whether or not it makes sense to you, whether or not it\u2019s comfortable, whether or not it\u2019s what you believe you should be feeling. Nonjudging is neutrally noticing your own internal states. With nonjudging, it doesn\u2019t matter how you feel; what matters is how you feel about how you feel. And the most wellness-promoting way to feel is\u2026 neutral. Normal # Social meaning : You are like social messages says you should be. Which is totally imposible because many social messages are opposites. True meaning : Totally healthy, just same parts as everyone else, organized in a unique way. Everyone who is healthy (physical and mentally) is normal. Social messages # Includes moral, media and medical messages. Moral messages : You are evil. If you want or like sex, you\u2019re a slut. Your virginity is your most valuable asset. If you\u2019ve had too many partners (\u201ctoo many\u201d = more than your male partner has had), you should be ashamed. There is only one right way to behave and one right way to feel about sex\u2014 not to feel anything about it at all but to accommodate the man to whom your body belongs. [\u2026] If you are sexually desirable, you are, by definition, unlovable, and a slut. Media messages : You are inadequate. Spanking, food play, m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois\u2026 you\u2019ve done all these things, right? Well, you\u2019ve at least had clitoral orgasms, vaginal orgasms, uterine orgasms, energy orgasms, extended orgasms, and multiple orgasms? And you\u2019ve mastered at least thirty-five different positions for intercourse? If you don\u2019t try all these things, you\u2019re frigid. If you\u2019ve had too few partners, don\u2019t watch porn, and don\u2019t have a collection of vibrators in your bedside table, you\u2019re a prude. Also: You\u2019re too fat and too thin; your breasts are too big and too small. Your body is wrong. If you\u2019re not trying to change it, you\u2019re lazy. If you\u2019re satisfied with yourself as you are, you\u2019re settling. And if you dare to actively like yourself, you\u2019re a conceited bitch. In short, you are doing it wrong. Do it differently. No, that\u2019s wrong, too, try something else. Forever. Medical messages : You are deseased. Sex causes disease and pregnancy, which makes it dangerous. But if you\u2019re ready to take that risk, sexual functioning should happen in a particular way\u2014desire, then arousal, then orgasm, preferably during intercourse, simultaneously with your partner\u2014and when it doesn\u2019t, there is a medical issue that you must address. Medically. With medication. Or possibly surgery. To the extent that a woman\u2019s sexual response differs from a man\u2019s, she is diseased\u2014except for pregnancy, which is what sex is for. Confidence: The map # Step 1: Analyce your sexuality # Ask yourself: What are my accelerators and brakes and how sensitives are they? What are my stressors and how sensitive they are? Which is my desire type? Do I have spontaneous, responsive or context-dependent desire? Does my genital response predicts my arousal? How much? How do I reach orgasm? Do I need clitoral stimulation? Tell yourself that whatever your answer is, you are normal. Your body is also normal. If you have a partner ask yourself what you think their responses would be. Then ask him/her to answer the questions. Let him/her know what your answers were. Step 2: Notice the gap # Your feelings are always true, so notice them. If you have negative feelings experiencing your sexuality probably it\u2019s your little monitor fault, noticing that the expectations you have for your goals are not being met. So close the gap by reality-check . This also applies to what you feel about your partner sexuality, i.e. you feel your partner should have \u201cmore\u201d\u2014Maybe you have spontaneous desire and you think your partner responsive desire as lesser (it\u2019s an opinion not a fact)\u2014sexual desire. Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual scripts . These scripts provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these scripts act as barriers between us and joy. Map and terrain metaphor # What would you say if a map doesn\u2019t match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes? Which is wrong, the map or the terrain? Everyone would probably say that it is the terrain that is wrong. But what if everyone says the map is right and it\u2019s the terrain you\u2019re looking at which\u2019s wrong? Our sexual scripts are our the map , and our experiences are our terrain. When our experiences don\u2019t match the map our brains try to make the map true, forcing our experience into the shape of the map . You feel your experiences should match the map , i.e. a gap. That is why the litte monitor activates. The first step toward joy is recognizing a mismatch between the map and the terrain, with the knowledge that the terrain is always right. Once you recognize this mismatch, you have to draw a new map grounded on science and your own experience. Why confidence is not enough? # Because maybe you already know what is true about yourself (and about your partner) but you don\u2019t accept it. So you hit your brakes . Scripts aren\u2019t about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it. There are some ways that may make you struggle reaching joy : To think of yourself as lesser. A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that \u2018responsive desire\u2019 is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire. Most women have \u201ca lesser desire?\u201d Yeowch. The construction of responsive desire as \u201clesser\u201d is not a \u201cfact,\u201d of course; it\u2019s a value judgment, an opinion. Solution : Notice that it\u2019s an opinion not a fact. Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are broken . The worst case is when these people are people you love. Solution : Trust you and science, not social messages . To have negative feelings about what is true of yourself, for being as you are. Solution : Don\u2019t lock up those feelings, address them by non-judging . Complete the stress cycle . Link your personality to one of those social messages . Smart womens don\u2019t want sex. Smart girls are interested in minds, not bodies; only stupid girls are ruled by their \u201cbase animal instincts.\u201d Solution : Notice you are just playing a role. People are always playing roles (as partner, parent, child, uncle, student, employee, boss, etc. \u2014You even behave differently with different groups of friends). But you are not the role you are playing, you are not even the role you play being alone. Everyone is free; so you don\u2019t have to play a role you have been playing. You probably didn\u2019t consciously choosen that role and it\u2019s just an absurd social message . Joy : The hard part # You sense, that sensesations generate a feeling, then you judge that feeling based on your beliefs and expectations\u2014that\u2019s your litte monitor . Step 3: How you feel about how you feel? # Once you have confidence and you had drawn a new map , how do you feel about what your map (your sexuality) is like? You may have negative feelings about it. Negative feelings hurts, so people ussually lock them deep inside themselves, without letting the stress cycle close and not healing themselves. Whenever you notice a negative feeling ask yourself (don\u2019t lock it): How I feel? Which negative feeling it is? What is making me feel this way? What are my thoughts about it? Am I judging it? On what belief or expectative do I base my judgment? It is this belief true? Do reality-check and heal that feeling by closing the stress cycle . Step 4: How to non-judge? # I used to think that it was the awareness of your internal state that mattered, but in study after study, \u201cobservation\u201d of internal state is not a significant predictor of wellbeing. Instead, the most important variable is \u201cnon-judging\u201d.","title":"Chapter 9: Love what is true"},{"location":"Come_As_You_Are_Emily_Nagoski/Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True/#chapter-9-love-what-is-true","text":"This chapter is about how to reach the ecstasy through confidence and joy in whole you.
