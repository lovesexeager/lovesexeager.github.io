# Chapter 9: Love what is true

This chapter is about how to reach the ecstasy through _confidence_ and _joy_ in whole you.

First is _confidence_, then _joy_. _Confidence_ is not enough, and _joy_ is the hard part.

## Definitions

- **Confidence**: Knowing what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life.

> Knowing that your genitals are made of the same parts as everyone else’s, organized in a unique way. Knowing about the brakes and accelerator. Knowing about context and about the difference between liking, wanting, and learning. Knowing about arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Knowing what’s really true, even when it’s not what you were taught “should” be true. Knowing what’s true, even when it’s not what you wish were true.

- **Joy**: Loving what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. 

> Loving your genitals, your brakes and accelerator, and the way your brain responds to context. Loving the context itself. Loving arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Loving what’s true, even when it’s not what you were taught “should” be true. Loving what’s true, even when it’s not what you wish were true.

- **Negative feelings**: Feelings like hate, angry, frustration, despair, disappoinment and shame.

- **Broken**: Not _normal_, the social meaning. Ussually implies damaged, inadequate, or diseased. It's something wrong with you.

- **Script**: Something that should be that way.

- **Map (Model)**: An abstract representation of something that exists in reality. Our sexual _scripts_ are _maps_.

- **Observe**: Notice you internal experience.

- **Non-judge**: Not categorizing your internal experience as good or bad, right or wrong. 

> In other words, non-judging allows you to feel what you feel, whether or not it makes sense to you, whether or not it’s comfortable, whether or not it’s what you believe you should be feeling. Nonjudging is neutrally noticing your own internal states. With nonjudging, it doesn’t matter how you feel; what matters is how you feel about how you feel. And the most wellness-promoting way to feel is... neutral.

### _Normal_ 

- **Social meaning**: You are like _social messages_ says you should be. 

Which is totally imposible because many _social messages_ are opposites.

- **True meaning**: Totally healthy, just same parts as everyone else, organized in a unique way.

Everyone who is healthy (physical and mentally) is normal. 

### _Social messages_ 

Includes moral, media and medical messages.

- **Moral messages**: You are evil. 

> If you want or like sex, you’re a slut. Your virginity is your most valuable asset. If you’ve had too many
partners (“too many” = more than your male partner has had), you should be ashamed. There is only one right way to behave and one right way to feel about sex--- not to feel anything about it at all but to accommodate the man to whom your body belongs. [...] If you
are sexually desirable, you are, by definition, unlovable, and a slut.

- **Media messages**: You are inadequate.

> Spanking, food play, ménages à trois... you’ve done all these things, right? Well, you’ve at least had clitoral orgasms, vaginal orgasms, uterine orgasms, energy orgasms, extended orgasms, and multiple orgasms? And you’ve mastered at least thirty-five different positions for intercourse? If you don’t try all these things, you’re frigid. If you’ve had too few partners, don’t watch porn, and don’t have a collection of vibrators in your bedside table, you’re a prude. Also: You’re too fat and too thin; your breasts are too big and too small. Your body is wrong. If you’re not trying to change it, you’re lazy. If you’re satisfied with yourself as you are, you’re settling. And if you dare to actively like yourself, you’re a conceited bitch. In short, you are doing it wrong. Do it differently. No, that’s wrong, too, try something else. Forever.

- **Medical messages**: You are deseased.

> Sex causes disease and pregnancy, which makes it dangerous. But if you’re ready to take that risk, sexual functioning should happen in a particular way---desire, then arousal, then orgasm, preferably during intercourse, simultaneously with your partner---and when it doesn’t, there is a medical issue that you must address. Medically. With medication. Or possibly surgery. To the extent that a woman’s sexual response differs from a man’s, she is diseased---except for pregnancy, which is what sex is for. 

## Confidence: The map

### Step 1: Analyce your sexuality 

Ask yourself: 

- What are my _accelerators_ and _brakes_ and how sensitives are they?
- What are my _stressors_ and how sensitive they are?
- Which is my desire type? Do I have spontaneous, responsive or context-dependent desire? 
- Does my genital response predicts my arousal? How much?
- How do I reach orgasm? Do I need clitoral stimulation?

Tell yourself that whatever your answer is, you are normal. Your body is also normal.

If you have a partner ask yourself what you think their responses would be. Then ask him/her to answer the questions. Let him/her know what your answers were.

### Step 2: Notice the gap

Your feelings are always true, so notice them. If you have _negative feelings_ experiencing your sexuality probably it's your _little monitor_ fault, noticing that the expectations you have for your goals are not being met. So close the gap by [reality-check](True_Stories.md#reality-check).

This also applies to what you feel about your partner sexuality, i.e. you feel your partner **should** have "more"---Maybe you have spontaneous desire and you think your partner responsive desire as lesser (it's an opinion not a fact)---sexual desire.

Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual _scripts_. These _scripts_ provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these _scripts_ act as barriers between us and joy.

#### _Map_ and _terrain_ metaphor

What would you say if a _map_ doesn't match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes? Which is wrong, the map or the terrain? Everyone would probably say that it is the terrain that is wrong. But what if everyone says the _map_ is right and it's the terrain you're looking at which's wrong?

Our sexual _scripts_ are our the _map_, and our experiences are our terrain. When our experiences don't match the _map_ our brains try to make the _map_ true, forcing our experience into the shape of the _map_. You feel your experiences **should** match the _map_, i.e. a gap. That is why the _litte monitor_ activates.   

> The first step toward joy is recognizing a mismatch between the map and the terrain, with the knowledge that the terrain is always right.

Once you recognize this mismatch, you have to draw a new _map_ grounded on science and your own experience.

### Why _confidence_ is not enough?

Because maybe you already know what is true about yourself (and about your partner) but you don't accept it. So you hit your _brakes_. 

> Scripts aren’t about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it.

There are some ways that may make you struggle reaching _joy_:

- To think of yourself as lesser.

> A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you’re glossing over the fact that ‘responsive desire’ is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire.
Most women have "a lesser desire?" Yeowch.
The construction of responsive desire as “lesser” is not a “fact,” of course; it’s a value judgment, an opinion.

**Solution**: Notice that it's an opinion not a fact.

- Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are _broken_. The worst case is when these people are people you love.

**Solution**: Trust you and science, not _social messages_. 

- To have _negative feelings_ about what is true of yourself, for being as you are.

**Solution**: Don't lock up those feelings, address them by _non-judging_. Complete the _stress cycle_.

- Link your personality to one of those _social messages_.  

> Smart womens don’t want sex. Smart girls are interested in minds, not bodies; only stupid girls are ruled by their "base animal instincts."
  
**Solution**: Notice you are just playing a role. People are always playing roles (as partner, parent, child, uncle, student, employee, boss, etc. ---You even behave differently with different groups of friends). But you are not the role you are playing, you are not even the role you play being alone. Everyone is free; so you don't have to play a role you have been playing. You probably didn't consciously choosen that role and it's just an absurd _social message_.    

## _Joy_: The hard part

You sense, that sensesations generate a feeling, then you judge that feeling based on your beliefs and expectations---that's your _litte monitor_.

### Step 3: How you feel about how you feel?

Once you have _confidence_ and you had drawn a new _map_, how do you feel about what your _map_ (your sexuality) is like? You may have _negative feelings_ about it.

_Negative feelings_ hurts, so people ussually lock them deep inside themselves, without letting the _stress cycle_ close and not healing themselves.

Whenever you notice a _negative feeling_ ask yourself (don't lock it):

- How I feel? Which _negative feeling_ it is?
- What is making me feel this way?
- What are my thoughts about it? 
- Am I judging it?
- On what belief or expectative do I base my judgment?
- It is this belief true? 

Do [reality-check](True_Stories.md#reality-check) and heal that feeling by closing the _stress cycle_.

### Step 4: How to non-judge?

> I used to think that it was the awareness of your internal state that mattered, but in study after study, "observation" of internal state is not a significant predictor of wellbeing. Instead, the most important variable is "non-judging".
