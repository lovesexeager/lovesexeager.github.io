# Chapter 9: Love what is true

This chapter is about how to reach the ecstasy through confidence and joy in whole you.

First is _confidence_, then _joy_. _Confidence_ is not enough, and _joy_ is the hard part.

## Definitions

- **Confidence**: Knowing what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life.

> Knowing that your genitals are made of the same parts as everyone else’s, organized in a unique way. Knowing about the brakes and accelerator. Knowing about context and about the difference between liking, wanting, and learning. Knowing about arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Knowing what’s really true, even when it’s not what you were taught “should” be true. Knowing what’s true, even when it’s not what you wish were true.

- **Joy**: Loving what is true about your body, mind, sexuality, and life. 

> Loving your genitals, your brakes and accelerator, and the way your brain responds to context. Loving the context itself. Loving arousal nonconcordance and responsive desire. Loving what’s true, even when it’s not what you were taught “should” be true. Loving what’s true, even when it’s not what you wish were true.

- **Negative feelings**: Feelings like hate, angry, frustration, despair, disappoinment and shame.

- **Broken**: Not _normal_, the cultural meaning. Ussually implies damaged, inadequate, or diseased. It's something wrong with you.

- **Script**: Something that shoud be that way.

- **Map (Model)**: An abstract representation of something that exists in reality. Our sexual _scripts_ are _maps_.

### _Normal_ 

- **Cultural meaning**: You are like _cultural messages_ says you should be. 

Which is totally imposible because many cultural messages are opposites.

- **True meaning**: Totally healthy, just same parts as everyone else, organized in a unique way.

Everyone who is healthy (physical and mentally) is normal. 

### _Cultural messages_ 

Includes moral, media and medical messages.

- **Moral messages**: You are evil. 

> If you want or like sex, you’re a slut. Your virginity is your most valuable asset. If you’ve had too many
partners (“too many” = more than your male partner has had), you should be ashamed. There is only one right way to behave and one right way to feel about sex—not to feel anything about it at all but to accommodate the man to whom your body belongs. [...] If you
are sexually desirable, you are, by definition, unlovable, and a slut.

- **Media messages**: You are inadequate.

> Spanking, food play, ménages à trois... you’ve done all these things, right? Well, you’ve at least had clitoral orgasms, vaginal orgasms, uterine orgasms, energy orgasms, extended orgasms, and multiple orgasms? And you’ve mastered at least thirty-five different positions for intercourse? If you don’t try all these things, you’re frigid. If you’ve had too few partners, don’t watch porn, and don’t have a collection of vibrators in your bedside table, you’re a prude. Also: You’re too fat and too thin; your breasts are too big and too small. Your body is wrong. If you’re not trying to change it, you’re lazy. If you’re satisfied with yourself as you are, you’re settling. And if you dare to actively like yourself, you’re a conceited bitch. In short, you are doing it wrong. Do it differently. No, that’s wrong, too, try something else. Forever.

- **Medical messages**: You are deseased.

> Sex causes disease and pregnancy, which makes it dangerous. But if you’re ready to take that risk, sexual functioning should happen in a particular way — desire, then arousal, then orgasm, preferably during intercourse, simultaneously with your partner — and when it doesn’t, there is a medical issue that you must address. Medically. With medication. Or possibly surgery. To the extent that a woman’s sexual response differs from a man’s, she is diseased — except for pregnancy, which is what sex is for. 

## Why _confidence_ is not enough?

Because maybe you know what is true about yourself but you don't accept it. So you hit your Brakes. 

There are three ways that may make you struggle reaching _joy_:

- To think of yourself as lesser.

> A reader of my blog learned about responsive desire but commented, I think you’re glossing over the fact that ‘responsive desire’ is a lesser desire than [spontaneous] desire.
Most women have “a lesser desire?” Yeowch.
The construction of responsive desire as “lesser” is not a “fact,” of course; it’s a value judgment, an opinion.

- Know and accept yourself until society tells you again and again that you are _broken_. The worst case is when these people are people you love.

- To have _negative feelings_ about what is true of yourself, for being as you are.

## The _map_ and the terrain

## How to bridge from _confidence_ to _joy_?

### Step 1: Your feelings are always true

Your feelings are always true, so notice them. If you have _negative feelings_ experiencing your sexuality probably it's your _little monitor_ fault, noticing that the expectations you have for your goals are not being met. So close the gap by [reality-check](True_Stories.md#reality-check).

Many our goals, such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse, are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves, but the culture has chosen them for us through sexual _scripts_. These _scripts_ provide the structure for the beliefs through which we interpret the sexual world. So these _scripts_ act as barriers between us and joy.

#### The _map_ and _terrain_

What would you say if a _map_ doesn't match the terrain you are seeing with your own eyes? Which is wrong, the map or the terrain? Everyone would probably say that it is the terrain that is wrong. But what if everyone says the map is right and it's the terrain you're looking at which's wrong?

Our sexual _scripts_ are our the _map_, and our experiences are our terrain.
