## _Reality check_

### Is this the rigth goal for me?

> In chapter 5, when Laurie decided to stop trying to want sex with Johnny and just allowed herself not to, she closed the gap between where she was and where she wanted to be, which opened the door to affection without performance demand.

She allowed herself to be a woman who doesn't want sex to release the pressure she was under. This way she was capable of enjoying sex without pressure.

### Am Im putting in the right amount of the rigth kind of effort?

> In chapter 8, when Olivia meditated her way to an extended orgasm, she was practicing being present as she was, rather than pushing forward to some goal. She kept the same goal—ecstasy—but she changed the kind of effort she was investing.

From quick sex to reach orgasm to slow sex for enjoyment and ecstasy, achieving longer-lasting and better orgasms.

> And in chapter 7, when Merritt, instead of trying on the aspirational identity of a woman who loves sex, embraced the identity of a woman who did not want sex, she was changing the kind of effort she invested, to attain her goal of trusting herself. The result was not sinking down forever into a state of not wanting sex—on the contrary! Allowing herself to be where she was opened the door to where she wanted to go.

From striving to want to be a woman who likes sex to striving to trust herself.

### Are my expectations of how much effort this particular goal requires realistic?

> Since Ms. B. entered her mid-40s, she says, sex has been more about smoke and mirrors than thunder and lightning. She is rarely if ever interested enough to initiate it with her partner of 10 years, and she does not reach climax during the act.
She wishes it were otherwise. 

> Having gotten this far in the book, you’ll recognize that Ms. B.’s desire style
may be responsive rather than spontaneous, and it sounds like she’s not reliably
orgasmic with intercourse. Both of these put her squarely in the majority.

The expectations she had about how much effort it takes to reach orgasm by intercourse without clitoral stimulation was unrealistic.
