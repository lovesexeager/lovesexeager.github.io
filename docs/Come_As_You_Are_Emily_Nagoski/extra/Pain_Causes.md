Some main causes of pain during sex are lack of lubrication and vaginismus.

## Lack of lubrication. 

### Possible causes

- You are not enough aroused. (Remember _non-concordance_: arousal not implies wet, nor the contrary).
- Post-menopausal. Post-menopausal women may experience dryness.
- You are turning on any brake. You don't feel safe or comfortable, you are stressed or you have a _negative feeling_. 

### Possible solutions

- Make your _context_ positive. Hit your _accelerators_ without hitting your _brakes_.
- Complete your _stress cycle_.
- Have a good preliminary.
- Use lube. Water based preferably.

## Vaginismus

_Vaginismus_ is chronic tension of the pelvic floor muscle, which makes penetration of the vagina either impossible or very painful.

**[Possible causes](https://www.vaginismus.com/causes-of-vaginismus)**: 

- Fears: Anticipation of pain, fear to be damaged, pregnancy, virginity, etc.

**Solution**: Make your context safe, use contraceptive protection, communicate your feelings with your partner.  

- Anxiety or stress.

**Solution**: Complete the _stress cycle_.

- Trauma: Sexual abuse, physical attack, repressed memories, etc.  

**Solution**: [Heal the trauma](../Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True.md#healing-the-trauma).

- Partner: Abuse, emotional detachment, fear of commitment, distrust, anxiety about being vulnerable, etc.

**Solution**: Tell your partner how you feel and/or seek for help.

- Childhood experiences: Overly rigid parenting, unbalanced religious teaching (i.e. "Sex is BAD"), inadequate sex education, etc.

**Solution**: Get rid of _social messages_. [Draw a new _map_](../Chapter_9_Love_What_Is_True.md#step-2-notice-the-gap).

- Pee, poop and fart: Many people have fear to pee, poop and fart out of their houses. So they keep theirs pelvic floor in chronic tension.

**Solution**: Pee and poop is natural, fart too. Notice when you feel like peeing, pooping or farting and go to the bathroom---If you just want to fart, you can fart wherever you are. Even if you can take a walk while you fart so that no one knows it was you---as often as you need to, no matter where you are. If you are disgusted by sitting on a public toilet, take enough toilet paper and clean the toilet seat cover well before you sit down. 

- Physical reasons: Medical reasons, childbirth, age-related changes, inadequate lubrication, pelvic trauma, medications.

**Solution**: Self-compassion, no pressure and lube. Involve your partner.
