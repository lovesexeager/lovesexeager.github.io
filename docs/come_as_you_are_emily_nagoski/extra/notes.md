# Notes 

## The dual control model

> According to their "dual control model", the sexual response mechanism in our brains consists of a pair of universal components---a sexual accelerator and sexual brakes---and those components respond to broad categories of sexual stimuli---including genital sensations, visual stimulation, and emotional context. And the sensitivity of each component varies from person to person.

> This is the mechanism underlying the behavior—the why and the how. And it’s the rule that governs the story I’ll be telling in this book: We’re all made of the same parts, but in each of us, those parts are organized in a unique way that may change over our life span.

## Summary

Senses --> prior learning + mental state --> Initial decision + expectations --> _emotional one ring_ + _little monitor_ --> feelings  

## Extended orgasms

Advice for people with high sexual desire, i.e. sensitive accelerators. 

> "Slow down. Stay still." That’s Olivia’s advice for all higher-desire partners. "Don’t chase, don’t push or pull. Be like the person with the broom on a curling team. Clear the path to sex."
